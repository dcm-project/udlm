"""Address resolution for the scoped-Class hierarchy (ADR-038 / realization-plan P0).

An address names an element as seen from a Class, in either of the two ADR-038 notations — they are
the same coordinate and resolve identically:
  - **dot / compact**:  `Compute.VM#cpu`                              (segments dotted; element after `#`)
  - **URL** (preferred): `https://udlm.dev/class/Compute/VM#cpu`      (segments slashed; element as fragment)
The URL form follows OData/Redfish addressing (`@odata.id`) and the ADR-038 `https://<authority>/Compute/VM`
convention; any authority is accepted on input (federated addressing), and the canonical URL is emitted.

Resolution walks the inheritance chain to the *owning* Class (the nearest scope, self→Base, that
declares the element) and its effective schema — the coordinate the ADR-054 projection axis traverses,
and what query, impact, and RBAC scope against. One resolver, both notations.

  resolve(address) -> {"address", "url", "authority", "via_class", "owning_class", "scope",
                       "element", "schema", "inherited": bool}   (raises KeyError on unknown Class/element)
  CLI:  resolve_class_address.py Compute.VM#cpu https://udlm.dev/class/Process/OSPatch#idempotency

Resolution rules:
- The element is looked up from the addressed Class upward; the *nearest* declaring Class owns it
  (a descendant that refines an element owns the refined shape at its scope — Liskov guarantees it
  narrows, never contradicts).
- `inherited` is true when the owning Class is an ancestor of the addressed Class (the common case:
  `Compute.VM#cpu` is owned by the `Compute` Base Class).
- An element the addressed Class cannot see (declared on neither it nor an ancestor) is a KeyError —
  the same dangling-reference discipline data references use (invalid edges resolve deterministically).
