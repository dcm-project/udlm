## 1. Purpose

This document defines the complete ownership model for UDLM entities — specifically the three ownership patterns that govern how resources are owned, shared, and allocated across Tenants. It establishes precise vocabulary and clear boundaries between concepts that are frequently conflated:

- **Ownership** — who is accountable for a resource's lifecycle and costs
- **Shareable** — multiple entities have a stake in a single resource that they do not own
- **Allocatable** — a pool resource yields independently owned sub-resources to consumers

Getting this model right is foundational. It governs decommission safety (can this resource be removed?), cost attribution (who pays for this?), cross-tenant visibility (who can see this?), drift accountability (whose responsibility is remediation?), and placement decisions (which providers serve allocation requests?).

## 2. The Three Ownership Patterns

> **Note — `ownership_model` is a conceptual classifier, not (yet) a meta-schema field.** The
> `ownership_model:` shown in the examples below expresses *intent*; it is a **deferred candidate data
> point** (see `registry/SPEC-DESIGN-REQUIREMENTS.md` → *Candidate / deferred data points*), not a
> validated field on a Resource Type Spec today — the patterns are currently expressed through
> relationships (pools, stakes) and the realized-entity `ownership`. If adopted it will be
> `ownership_model` (snake_case, per `registry/naming-conventions.md` §4; hyphenated enum values). Treat the examples as illustrative.

### 2.1 Whole Allocation (Consumer Owns the Entity)

**What it means:** The consumer receives the entire resource entity. It belongs exclusively to them. They own it outright — it is in their Tenant, they control its lifecycle, they bear its costs.

**Structural model:**
```
Platform Tenant owns: the infrastructure, compute capacity, network fabric
Consumer Tenant owns: VirtualMachine-A (a distinct entity)
Consumer Tenant owns: VirtualMachine-B (another distinct entity)
```
There is no relationship between VirtualMachine-A and the infrastructure Tenant — the consumer simply used a Service Provider to provision a resource. Once provisioned, the entity belongs to the consumer's Tenant entirely. The platform Tenant has no visibility into the consumer's entity unless an explicit Information Provider or cross-tenant relationship is established.

**Examples:** VirtualMachine, Container, StorageVolume, NetworkInterface, DNSRecord.

**Resource Type Spec declaration:**
```yaml
resource_type_spec:
  fqn: Compute.VirtualMachine
  ownership_model: whole_allocation
  # Each consumer request produces an entity owned entirely by the requesting Tenant
```

**Decommission behavior:** Straightforward. The owning Tenant decommissions the entity. The provider releases the underlying physical resources. No other Tenant is affected.

---

### 2.2 Allocation (Consumer Owns a Carved Portion)

**What it means:** A *pool* resource is owned by a platform or provider Tenant (the pool owner). When a consumer requests a resource of this type, they receive an *allocation* — a new, distinct entity carved from the pool. The consumer **owns** their allocation. The pool owner retains ownership of the pool.

**The key distinction from Shareable:** The consumer's allocation is an independent entity with its own UUID, its own Tenant membership, its own lifecycle. It is not a reference to the pool — it is a new thing that came from the pool.

**Structural model:**
```
NetworkOps Tenant owns: IPAddressPool 198.51.100.0/24 (pool entity)
  │
  ├── AppTeam Tenant owns: IPAddress 198.51.100.45/32  ← allocation entity (new UUID, AppTeam's Tenant)
  ├── DevTeam Tenant owns: IPAddress 198.51.100.46/32  ← allocation entity (new UUID, DevTeam's Tenant)
  └── OpsTeam Tenant owns: IPAddress 198.51.100.47/32  ← allocation entity (new UUID, OpsTeam's Tenant)
```

The IPAddress entities are not pointers to the pool — they are real entities owned by their Tenants. If AppTeam decommissions 198.51.100.45/32, it is released back to the pool. The pool capacity increases. No other Tenant's allocation is affected.

**Examples:** IPAddress (from IPAddressPool), Subnet (from SubnetPool), VLAN ID (from VLANIDPool), StorageVolume (from StoragePool), PublicCertificate (from CertificateAuthorityPool).

**Resource Type Spec declarations (both pool and allocation):**
```yaml
# The pool resource type
resource_type_spec:
  fqn: Network.IPAddressPool
  ownership_model: whole_allocation    # the pool entity is owned outright by the platform Tenant
  is_pool: true
  allocation_produces_type: Network.IPAddress
  capacity_tracking: true              # DCM tracks used/available capacity

# The allocation resource type
resource_type_spec:
  fqn: Network.IPAddress
  ownership_model: allocation          # each instance is an allocation from a pool
  allocated_from_pool_type: Network.IPAddressPool
  # When a consumer requests Network.IPAddress, a realization:
  # 1. Runs placement to find an eligible IPAddressPool
  # 2. The pool provider carves out a specific IP
  # 3. Creates a new IPAddress entity owned by the requesting Tenant
  # 4. Records an AllocationRecord relationship between the entity and the pool
```

**AllocationRecord relationship:**
Every allocation entity carries an `allocated_from` relationship to its source pool:

```yaml
relationship:
  relationship_uuid: <uuid>
  type: allocated_from
  source_entity_uuid: <uuid>       # the allocation (e.g., IPAddress 198.51.100.45/32)
  target_entity_uuid: <uuid>       # the pool (e.g., IPAddressPool 198.51.100.0/24)
  source_tenant_uuid: <uuid>       # AppTeam Tenant
  target_tenant_uuid: <uuid>       # NetworkOps Tenant — cross-tenant relationship
  allocation_ref:
    allocation_size: "1/32"        # what was carved from the pool
    allocated_at: <ISO 8601>
    allocated_by_actor_uuid: <uuid>
    allocation_metadata:
      pool_capacity_before: 65534
      pool_capacity_after: 65533
```

**Decommission behavior:** When the consumer decommissions their allocation entity, DCM dispatches a decommission payload to the provider. The provider releases the specific allocated resource back to the pool. The pool's available capacity increases. The AllocationRecord relationship is terminated. The allocation entity enters DECOMMISSIONED state. The pool entity is unaffected.

**Cross-tenant visibility:** The allocation entity is in the consumer's Tenant. The consumer cannot see the pool entity unless an explicit cross-tenant relationship or Information Provider is configured. The pool owner can see allocation counts and capacity via the provider's capacity reporting API — they cannot see the consumer's entity data.

---

### 2.3 Shareable (Consumer Has a Stake, Not Ownership)

**What it means:** A single resource entity is owned by one Tenant (the resource owner) and multiple consumers attach to, depend on, or reference it. Consumers have a *stake* — a relationship that affects the resource's lifecycle — but they do not own any portion of it. The resource's lifecycle is governed entirely by its owner.

**The key distinction from Allocation:** No new entity is created for the consumer. The consumer receives a relationship to the existing resource, not a new sub-entity. The consumer does not own anything — they hold a stake.

**Structural model:**
```
NetworkOps Tenant owns: VLAN-100 (single entity — there is only one VLAN-100)
  │
  ├── AppTeam has stake: VM-A attached to VLAN-100   (relationship, not ownership)
  ├── DevTeam has stake: VM-B attached to VLAN-100   (relationship, not ownership)
  └── OpsTeam has stake: VM-C attached to VLAN-100   (relationship, not ownership)
```

VLAN-100 belongs to NetworkOps. AppTeam, DevTeam, and OpsTeam each have a VM attached to it. If DevTeam decommissions VM-B, VLAN-100 is unaffected — it still exists and serves VM-A and VM-C. If NetworkOps wants to decommission VLAN-100, they cannot do so while VMs are attached. Decommission is deferred until all stakes are released.

**Examples:** VLAN (network fabric shared by many VMs), NetworkSegment, SharedFileSystem, DNS Zone, NTP Server, Certificate Authority (as a service), Transit Gateway.

**Resource Type Spec declaration:**
```yaml
resource_type_spec:
  fqn: Network.VLAN
  ownership_model: shareable
  # A single VLAN entity exists; consumers attach to it via relationships
  # Consumers do not receive their own VLAN entity
  decommission_policy:
    defer_while_active_stakes: true
    minimum_stake_count: 0       # can decommission when all stakes released
    # Some resources may require minimum_stake_count: 1
    # e.g., a DNS Zone that should never be empty
```

**Stake relationship:**
```yaml
relationship:
  relationship_uuid: <uuid>
  type: attached_to          # or: depends_on, references, uses
  source_entity_uuid: <uuid>   # VM-A (consumer's entity)
  target_entity_uuid: <uuid>   # VLAN-100 (shared resource)
  source_tenant_uuid: <uuid>   # AppTeam Tenant
  target_tenant_uuid: <uuid>   # NetworkOps Tenant
  stake:
    is_active: true
    staked_at: <ISO 8601>
    staked_by_actor_uuid: <uuid>
    stake_strength: <required|preferred|optional>
    # required: VM cannot function without VLAN attachment (blocks VLAN decommission)
    # preferred: VM prefers attachment but can function without it
    # optional: informational stake only
```

**Decommission behavior:** VLAN-100 cannot be decommissioned while any `stake_strength: required` stakes exist. The decommission attempt is deferred — not rejected — and a `DECOMMISSION_DEFERRED` event is generated. DCM notifies the resource owner of all active required stakes. The owner can request that stakeholders release their stakes (by decommissioning their VMs or migrating to a different VLAN) before decommission proceeds.

**Cross-tenant visibility:** The consumer's VM can reference VLAN-100 (read access for attachment purposes). The consumer cannot modify VLAN-100 or see its owner's configuration details unless an explicit cross-tenant authorization grants that. The resource owner (NetworkOps) can see all active stakes on their resource — this is how they know which consumers are affected by a planned decommission.

## 3. Hybrid Case — Allocation from a Shareable Pool

Some resources combine both patterns. A Subnet Pool is an allocatable pool. Each allocation (a specific /28) is owned by the consumer. But the /28 has a stake relationship to the parent /16 (which is shareable — owned by the network team, referenced by all subnets).

```
NetworkOps Tenant owns: SupernetPool 203.0.113.0/24 (allocatable pool)
  │
  ├── NetworkOps Tenant owns: 203.0.113.0/25 (allocation from /24 — NetworkOps-owned)
  │     NetworkOps Tenant owns: 203.0.113.0/26 (allocation from /25 — NetworkOps-owned)
  │
  └── NetworkOps Tenant owns: 203.0.113.128/25 (allocation from /24 — NetworkOps-owned, shared)
        ├── AppTeam Tenant owns: 203.0.113.128/26  ← consumer allocation (owned by AppTeam)
        │     └── stake: attached to 203.0.113.128/25 (shareable — NetworkOps)
        └── DevTeam Tenant owns: 203.0.113.192/26  ← consumer allocation (owned by DevTeam)
              └── stake: attached to 203.0.113.128/25 (shareable — NetworkOps)
```

The consumer-facing 203.0.113.128/26 is an allocation — AppTeam owns it. The parent 203.0.113.128/25 is shareable — NetworkOps owns it, AppTeam and DevTeam both have stakes. The 203.0.113.128/26 has both an `allocated_from` relationship (to the /25 pool that produced it) and an `attached_to` relationship (stake in the parent /25).

## 4. Ownership Model Summary

| Pattern | Consumer Gets | Consumer Owns | New Entity Created | Lifecycle Governed By | Cost Attribution |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Whole Allocation** | The entire resource | Yes, outright | Yes (same type) | Consumer Tenant | Consumer Tenant |
| **Allocation** | A carved sub-resource | Yes, the allocation | Yes (sub-type) | Consumer Tenant | Consumer Tenant |
| **Shareable** | A stake/relationship | No — stake only | No new entity | Resource Owner Tenant | Resource Owner Tenant (shared cost attribution possible via policy) |

---

## 5. How Placement Differs by Ownership Model

Each ownership model implies a different placement shape. Placement itself is admin-policy-driven and runtime (see the DCM architecture documentation and [policy-contract.md](../contracts/policy-contract.md) `placement`); what the data model fixes is *what placement is selecting for* in each case:

- **Whole Allocation:** placement selects a provider with available capacity; the provider provisions the resource and returns it owned by the requesting Tenant.
- **Allocation:** placement selects an eligible **pool** resource with sufficient available capacity; the pool provider carves an allocation, and a new allocation entity is created in the requesting Tenant with an `allocated_from` AllocationRecord to the pool.
- **Shareable:** placement finds the existing shareable resource instance that satisfies the consumer's attachment constraints; **no new entity is provisioned** — a stake relationship is registered. If no eligible shareable instance exists, the request fails outright (unlike Allocation, where failure means insufficient pool capacity).

---

## 6. Decommission Safety Model

The three patterns have different decommission safety behaviors:

**Whole Allocation decommission:**
- Owner Tenant initiates decommission
- Policy checks for required relationships (do other entities depend on this?)
- If required dependencies exist → `DECOMMISSION_DEFERRED` until dependencies release
- If no required dependencies → dispatch decommission to provider → DECOMMISSIONED

**Allocation decommission:**
- Consumer Tenant initiates decommission of their allocation entity
- DCM dispatches decommission to pool provider
- Pool provider releases the resource back to pool
- AllocationRecord relationship terminated
- Pool `available_count` increases
- Allocation entity → DECOMMISSIONED
- Pool entity is unaffected

**Shareable decommission:**
- Resource owner Tenant initiates decommission of the shared resource
- DCM checks `active_stake_count` for `stake_strength: required` stakes
- If required stakes > 0 → `DECOMMISSION_DEFERRED`
  - Notifications to all required stakeholders
  - Owner retries decommission after stakeholders release
- If required stakes == 0 → dispatch decommission to provider → DECOMMISSIONED
  - Any remaining `optional` stakes are automatically terminated

---

## 7. Cost Accountability

What the ownership model fixes is the **cost-accountable Tenant** — a data-model fact:

- **Whole Allocation and Allocation:** the owning Tenant is accountable for the entity's cost.
- **Shareable:** the resource owner Tenant is accountable by default; costs may be redistributed to stakeholders (owner-bears-all, equal split, proportional-by-usage, chargeback).

UDLM does not model or calculate cost. Which cost model applies, and any redistribution across stakeholders, is admin **policy** evaluated against an external metering model — see [ADR-COST-001](../registry/instances/adr-cost-metering-placement.json) and the metering & billing extension. UDLM carries only the accountability edge (who bears the cost) via the ownership and stake relationships above.

---

## 8. Ownership Invariants

These `OWN-00x` rows are invariants of the ownership model — constraints the
model guarantees, not runtime governance policy.

| Invariant | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `OWN-001` | `whole_allocation` resources are owned entirely by the requesting Tenant from the moment of realization. The providing platform Tenant has no ownership claim. |
| `OWN-002` | `allocation` resources are owned entirely by the requesting Tenant. The pool owner retains ownership of the pool entity only. AllocationRecord relationships are the only cross-Tenant link. |
| `OWN-003` | `shareable` resources are owned by a single Tenant. Consumers hold stakes (relationships) only. No consumer owns any portion of a shareable resource. |
| `OWN-004` | Decommission of a shareable resource is deferred while any `required` strength stakes are active. Optional stakes are terminated automatically on shareable resource decommission. |
| `OWN-005` | Allocation entity decommission releases the allocation back to the source pool. The pool entity is never decommissioned by an allocation decommission. |
| `OWN-006` | Cost attribution for shareable resources defaults to the resource owner Tenant. A cost attribution policy may redistribute costs to stakeholders. |
| `OWN-007` | The ownership model for a resource type is declared in the Resource Type Specification and cannot be changed at the entity level. Ownership model is a type-level invariant. |
| `OWN-008` | Cross-tenant AllocationRecord and stake relationships require that the requesting Tenant has either an active cross-tenant authorization or the resource type is declared as publicly allocatable/stakeable in its Resource Type Spec. |
