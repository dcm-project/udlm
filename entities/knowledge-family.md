# UDLM — Knowledge Entity-Type Family

**Document Status:** Draft (introduced 2026-06-08)
**Document Type:** Entity Reference
**Family:** Knowledge (architecture / capability knowledge) — anchored by **DAV**

> The three foundational abstractions are in [foundations.md](../foundations/foundations.md);
> the family concept in [Entity-Type Families](../foundations/entity-type-families.md).
> **This document maps to: DATA.**
> **Universality:** these are UDLM definitions grouped here for organization. They are
> **free to use by any realization, regardless of family** — DCM or any peer may use a
> `Capability` exactly as DAV does. Constraints apply to *instances* (ownership,
> classification, scope), never to these definitions.
>
> **Realization:** `dav/docs/capability-catalog-design.md`. Case study:
> [`../docs/case-study-dav-knowledge-realization.md`](../docs/case-study-dav-knowledge-realization.md).

## 1. Domain

The Knowledge family models **architecture and capability knowledge** — the artifacts a
system reasons about when it asks *"what should be able to happen, what does it take, and
where are the gaps?"* Where the Resource family tracks resources through **provisioning**,
the Knowledge family tracks definitions through **curation**: proposed → reviewed →
canonical, against a backdrop of what is **observed** in the field.

## 2. Lifecycle archetype — curation (the family's four-state interpretation)

Every Knowledge entity is UDLM Data and exists in the four states; the family interprets
them for curated knowledge:

| UDLM state | Knowledge interpretation | Storage semantics |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Intent** | `PROPOSED` — a proposed definition ("what we think should exist") | append-only, immutable record of the proposal |
| **Requested** | `UNDER_REVIEW` — the proposal submitted into curation (the contribution under review) | append-only per review cycle |
| **Realized** | `CANONICAL` — accepted, authoritative | versioned snapshots, `is_current` flag |
| **Discovered** | `OBSERVED` — what an assessment / UC analysis observes in the field | ephemeral, refreshed per assessment/analysis run |

Shared state machine skeleton (per-type tweaks allowed):

```
OBSERVED ─┐                        (parallel evidence from the field)
          ▼
PROPOSED ──► UNDER_REVIEW ──► CANONICAL ──► DEPRECATED
   ▲             │
   └─────────────┘  (revision)
```

**The signature operation:** the gap between `CANONICAL` (what should be) and `OBSERVED`
(what an assessment found) is **drift detection applied to knowledge** — identical in shape
to the Resource family's Realized-vs-Discovered drift. This *is* DAV's gap analysis.

## 3. Shared semantics

- **Universal contracts honored:** UUID stable across lifecycle; the artifact-metadata
  block (handle, version, status, owned_by, created_by, created_via); field-level
  provenance; data classification; contributor identity (the LLM-proposes / human-curates
  step is UDLM's federated-contribution model).
- **Provenance is first-order:** every field records origin — e.g. a `Capability.domain`
  sourced from the DCM taxonomy vs an `evidence` field sourced from a specific assessment
  finding.
- **Classification defaults:** canonical, shared vocabulary (TaxonomyTerm, Alias,
  Antipattern seeded from public taxonomy) defaults **public**; engagement-derived
  instances (e.g. capabilities discovered in a client assessment) default
  **client-confidential**. Set per instance, per field.
- **Family tag:** every definition here carries `family: knowledge` — the disambiguation
  namespace (see [Entity-Type Families §6](../foundations/entity-type-families.md)). So
  `Capability [Knowledge]` is distinct from any same-named term in another family, and
  collision-prone words (`Process`, `Policy`, `Service`, `Provider`, `Capability`) stay
  unambiguous as "term + family". It disambiguates meaning; it does not restrict use.
- **Ownership / scope is instance-level**, per
  [Ownership, Sharing, and Allocation](../foundations/ownership-sharing-allocation.md):
  global / shared / domain / project tiers (DAV's tier+tags model maps onto this). The
  *definitions* below are universal; only the artifacts built from them are scoped.

## 4. Entity-type definitions

### 4.1 Capability
A discrete ability that must be present to realize use cases (platform, people/process, or
enablement). The unit the catalog inventories and the roadmap sequences.
- **Fields:** name (handle), description, pillar, domain (capability-domain prefix),
  normalization_status (normalized | proposed-gap | unmapped), demand (count/refs of UCs
  requiring it), leverage (foundational-dependency metric), evidence.
- **Relationships:** `normalized_to` → TaxonomyTerm; `depends_on` → Capability;
  `required_by` → UseCase *(future)*; `surfaced_by` → Assessment/Finding *(future)*.
- **States:** typically enters as `OBSERVED` (from an assessment) and/or `PROPOSED`, then
  `UNDER_REVIEW` → `CANONICAL`; `DEPRECATED` is terminal.

### 4.2 TaxonomyTerm
A canonical vocabulary term — the **normalization authority** the catalog normalizes onto.
- **Fields:** term (handle), definition, pillar, domain (prefix + name), parent
  (→ TaxonomyTerm), normalization_rules (how to normalize items for this subject matter),
  category (source grouping).
- **Relationships:** `parent` → TaxonomyTerm; normalized **by** Capability/Alias.
- **States:** `PROPOSED` (a back-fill candidate the catalog surfaced) → `UNDER_REVIEW` →
  `CANONICAL`. Seeded `CANONICAL` from an authoritative taxonomy (e.g. the DCM Taxonomy).
  `DEPRECATED` for retired terms.
- **Note:** TaxonomyTerm is the "spec"; Capability is "reality." Their gap drives back-fill
  (Discovered/OBSERVED capabilities with no term ⇒ propose a term ⇒ the taxonomy grows).

### 4.3 Alias
A normalization rule mapping a non-canonical string/term to its canonical TaxonomyTerm —
i.e. anti-vocabulary ("avoid → use instead") and discovered synonyms.
- **Fields:** avoid (handle), use_instead, reason, source (taxonomy | discovered | manual).
- **Relationships:** `resolves_to` → TaxonomyTerm.
- **States:** `CANONICAL` when seeded from a taxonomy's anti-vocabulary; `PROPOSED` →
  `CANONICAL` for synonyms discovered during normalization.

### 4.4 Antipattern
A pattern to avoid relative to the taxonomy/architecture (a "what not to do," with the
recommended alternative).
- **Fields:** name (handle), description, why, instead (recommended pattern), pillar,
  domain.
- **Relationships:** `related_to` → TaxonomyTerm / Capability.
- **States:** `PROPOSED` → `CANONICAL`; `DEPRECATED` when superseded.

## 5. Relationship graph (summary)

```
   Assessment/Finding ──surfaces──► Capability ──normalized_to──► TaxonomyTerm ◄──parent── TaxonomyTerm
        (future)                       │  ▲                            ▲
                                       │  └──depends_on (Capability)   │ resolves_to
                                  required_by                          │
                                       ▼                            Alias
                                   UseCase (future)        Antipattern ──related_to──► TaxonomyTerm / Capability
```

## 6. Future members
`UseCase`, `Gap`, `Assessment`, `Finding` extend this family as DAV's UDLM-conformance
expands beyond the capability catalog (the pilot). Each follows the curation archetype and
the universal contracts; all remain universal definitions, free to use by any realization.
