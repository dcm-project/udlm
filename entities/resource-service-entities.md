## 1. Purpose

This document defines the two fundamental transactional concepts in UDLM — the **Resource/Service Request** and the **Resource/Service Entity** — and establishes the ownership models, lifecycle principles, and provider relationship rules that govern them.

Understanding the distinction between a Request and an Entity, and the principle that the realization is the authoritative system of record for all resource data regardless of operational ownership, is essential to understanding how a conformant UDLM peer achieves its core goals of auditability, lifecycle management, and sovereignty.

---

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Resource/Service Request

A **Resource/Service Request** is what a consumer submits to a UDLM realization — the declared intent to consume a resource or service. It is the consumer side of the transaction.

- Created when a consumer submits a request via a supported ingress surface (Web UI, Consumer API)
- Captured as the **Intent State** before any processing
- Processed into the **Requested State** after assembly and policy validation
- Is the initiating event that causes a Resource/Service Entity to be created

A Request is not a thing — it is an **instruction**. It describes what the consumer wants. The provider acts on the Requested State to produce an Entity.

### 2.2 Resource/Service Entity

A **Resource/Service Entity** is the "thing" produced by a provider as a result of fulfilling a Resource/Service Request. It is the provider side of the transaction — the allocation made real.

- Created when a provider fulfills a Requested State payload
- Returned to the realization in unified data model format via Denaturalization
- Captured as the **Realized State** in the Realized Store
- Assigned to a **Tenant** — the ownership boundary
- Has a UUID, full provenance chain, and complete lifecycle from creation to decommission
- Is the unit of consumption, cost attribution, drift detection, and audit

A Resource/Service Entity IS a thing — it exists, it has state, it has an owner, and the realization manages its lifecycle.

### 2.3 The Critical Distinction

```
Consumer submits        →  Resource/Service REQUEST  →  Intent/Requested State
Provider fulfills       →  Resource/Service ENTITY   →  Realized State
Realization manages     →  ENTITY persists            →  Drift/Audit/Cost/Rehydration
```

---

## 3. The Realization as Authoritative Owner of All Resource Data

This is the most fundamental principle governing Resource/Service Entities:

**The UDLM realization is ALWAYS the system of record for Resource/Service Entity data. The realization is ALWAYS authoritative for the resource definition. The realization ALWAYS owns the lifecycle. This applies regardless of the operational ownership model.**

The operational ownership model (described in Section 4) determines who has authority to operate on a Resource/Service Entity. It does not affect the realization's data ownership. Specifically:

- The realization owns the **data definition** of every Resource/Service Entity — what it is, what it should be, what it was
- The realization owns the **lifecycle** — from Requested through Realized to Decommissioned
- The realization is **authoritative** — if a provider reports a change the realization was not aware of, the realization acts on it according to policy
- The realization acts as the **Tenant advocate** — it protects the Tenant's interests in all provider interactions
- Providers are **custodians** of the underlying infrastructure — they are not the system of record

**Unsanctioned change response vocabulary (substrate-closed):**

If a provider reports a state change that was not initiated by an authorized request, the Policy Engine evaluates the change and selects from the following closed action vocabulary:

| Response | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ALERT` | Notify appropriate personas — Tenant owner, SRE, Auditor |
| `REVERT` | Instruct provider to revert to the declared realized state |
| `UPDATE_DEFINITION` | Accept the change and update the realized state definition |
| `INVESTIGATE` | Flag for human review before action |
| `DECOMMISSION` | Initiate decommission if the change represents unrecoverable deviation |
| `ESCALATE` | Escalate to higher policy tier for decision |

The response is selected by Policy Engine evaluation against:
- The Resource/Service definition
- Service/Resource dependencies
- Consumer preferences
- Organizational and Tenant policies
- Sovereignty requirements

---

## 4. Ownership Models

UDLM defines four ownership models for Resource/Service Entities. Every Provider Catalog Item must declare which ownership model(s) it supports. The ownership model is recorded in the Resource/Service Entity's provenance at creation time.

### 4.1 Allocation Model

The provider retains internal ownership of the underlying infrastructure. The consumer owns the Resource/Service Entity (the allocation) in their Tenant. The provider can reclaim the underlying resource when the entity is decommissioned.

**Characteristics:**
- Provider retains asset ownership
- Consumer owns the allocation — the Entity in their Tenant
- Provider has reclaim rights on decommission
- Underlying infrastructure may be shared or subdivided
- The realization manages the Entity lifecycle; provider manages the underlying resource

**Examples:** Virtual Machine, Container, Network Port, IP Address, Firewall Rule, Database Instance

---

### 4.2 Whole Allocation Model

The entire physical or logical resource is allocated as a single indivisible unit to one consumer's Tenant. The provider retains internal ownership but the consumer has exclusive use of the whole resource. The resource cannot be subdivided or shared during the allocation period.

**Characteristics:**
- Provider retains asset ownership
- Consumer has exclusive, indivisible use
- The resource is not shared or subdivided
- Provider has reclaim rights on decommission
- The realization manages the Entity lifecycle

**Examples:** Dedicated Bare Metal server (provider-owned), Dedicated Network appliance, Whole storage array allocation

---

### 4.3 Full Transfer Model

The provider transfers complete ownership of the underlying resource to the consumer's Tenant. The Resource/Service Entity IS the resource — there is no separation between the allocation and the underlying infrastructure from the realization's perspective. The consumer controls the full lifecycle including decommissioning. The provider has no reclaim rights after transfer.

**Characteristics:**
- Ownership of the underlying resource transfers to the consumer's Tenant
- The Entity IS the resource — no allocation/infrastructure separation
- Consumer controls full lifecycle including decommission
- Provider has no reclaim rights post-transfer
- Transfer is recorded in provenance — permanent audit record
- The realization remains authoritative for data and lifecycle regardless of transfer

**Examples:** Transferred Bare Metal server, Licensed software asset, Dedicated hardware appliance transferred to consumer

---

### 4.4 Hybrid Transfer Model

Ownership can transfer multiple times across the lifecycle of the Resource/Service Entity. The current owner is always exactly one Tenant, but ownership can be formally reassigned through a governed ownership transfer process. Every transfer is tracked, auditable, and policy-governed.

**Characteristics:**
- Ownership is held by exactly one Tenant at any point in time
- Ownership can be transferred to another Tenant through a formal governed process
- Every transfer is recorded in the Entity's provenance chain — complete ownership history
- Transfer requires Policy Engine validation and authorization
- The receiving Tenant must accept the transfer — it cannot be forced
- The realization remains authoritative for data and lifecycle through all transfers

**Transfer Provenance Record:**
```yaml
ownership_transfer:
  sequence: <transfer number — 1 for first transfer, 2 for second, etc.>
  from_tenant_uuid: <uuid of transferring tenant>
  to_tenant_uuid: <uuid of receiving tenant>
  transfer_timestamp: <ISO 8601>
  authorized_by: <uuid of authorizing policy or persona>
  transfer_reason: <human-readable reason>
  policy_uuid: <uuid of policy that governed this transfer>
```

**Examples:** Bare Metal server reallocated between tenants, Hardware asset transferred between business units, Licensed resource reassigned

---

### 4.5 Ownership Model Declaration

Every Provider Catalog Item must declare the ownership model(s) it supports:

```yaml
catalog_item:
  uuid: <uuid>
  ownership_models_supported:
    - allocation
    - whole_allocation
    - full_transfer
    - hybrid_transfer
  default_ownership_model: <one of the above>
  transfer_policy_required: <true|false>
  # If true, a policy must be referenced in any transfer request
```

---

## 5. Resource/Service Entity Lifecycle

Every Resource/Service Entity progresses through a defined lifecycle. The lifecycle states are part of the UDLM substrate vocabulary — peers MUST recognize and propagate them:

```
REQUESTED → PENDING → PROVISIONING → REALIZED → OPERATIONAL
                                                      │
                                          ┌───────────┼───────────┐
                                          ▼           ▼           ▼
                                      DEGRADED   MAINTENANCE  SUSPENDED
                                          │           │           │
                                          └───────────┼───────────┘
                                                      ▼
                                                DECOMMISSIONING
                                                      │
                                                      ▼
                                                DECOMMISSIONED
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `REQUESTED` | Request submitted, Intent State captured |
| `PENDING` | Requested State assembled, awaiting provider dispatch |
| `PROVISIONING` | Provider is fulfilling the request |
| `REALIZED` | Provider has fulfilled the request, Entity exists, Realized State captured |
| `OPERATIONAL` | Entity is in active use |
| `DEGRADED` | Entity is functioning but below expected operational characteristics |
| `MAINTENANCE` | Entity is undergoing planned maintenance |
| `SUSPENDED` | Entity is temporarily suspended — not operational but not decommissioned |
| `DECOMMISSIONING` | Decommission process initiated |
| `DECOMMISSIONED` | Entity no longer exists. Record retained permanently for audit. |

**Terminal states:** `DECOMMISSIONED` is the only terminal state. Once decommissioned, the Entity record is immutable and retained permanently.

---

## 6. Process Resource Entities

A **Process Resource Entity** is a distinct class of Resource/Service Entity representing ephemeral execution resources — automation jobs, playbooks, pipelines, workflows, and similar process-oriented resources.

### 6.1 Characteristics

- **Ephemeral lifecycle** — exists for the duration of execution, then terminates
- **No ongoing realized state to manage** — lifecycle ends at COMPLETED or FAILED
- **Execution record retained permanently** — the record of what the process did is immutable and permanent
- **Must belong to a Tenant** — even ephemeral resources must be owned
- **Must be in the provenance chain** of any Resource/Service Entity they affect

### 6.2 Process Resource Lifecycle

```
REQUESTED → INITIATED → EXECUTING → COMPLETED
                                  → FAILED
                                  → CANCELLED
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `REQUESTED` | Process request submitted |
| `INITIATED` | Provider has begun execution |
| `EXECUTING` | Process is actively running |
| `COMPLETED` | Process completed successfully — terminal |
| `FAILED` | Process failed — terminal |
| `CANCELLED` | Process cancelled before completion — terminal |

All terminal states are permanent. The execution record is immutable after reaching a terminal state.

### 6.3 Process Resource Entity Data Model

```yaml
process_resource_entity:
  uuid: <uuid>
  entity_class: process
  process_type: <playbook|workflow|pipeline|automation_job|script|other>
  tenant_uuid: <owning tenant uuid>
  version: <Major.Minor.Revision>
  lifecycle_state: <REQUESTED|INITIATED|EXECUTING|COMPLETED|FAILED|CANCELLED>
  input_payload:
    <the Requested State payload that initiated this process>
  output_payload:
    <what the process produced — in unified format>
  affected_entities:
    - entity_uuid: <uuid of affected Resource/Service Entity>
      effect_type: <created|modified|decommissioned|read>
      effect_description: <human-readable description>
  execution_record:
    initiated_timestamp: <ISO 8601>
    completed_timestamp: <ISO 8601 — when terminal state reached>
    executing_provider_uuid: <uuid of provider that executed>
    authorized_by_policy_uuid: <uuid of policy that authorized execution>
  provenance:
    <standard provenance metadata>
```

### 6.4 Provenance Obligation for Process Resources

If a Process Resource modifies the state of a Resource/Service Entity, that Entity's realized state provenance MUST reference the Process Resource Entity UUID as the source of the modification. This ensures that every change to an Infrastructure Entity can be traced back to the Process that caused it.

---

## 7. Provider Internal Lifecycle Model

Providers have their own internal infrastructure that underpins the Resource/Service Entities they create. While that internal infrastructure is opaque to consumers, the realization needs visibility into it for placement, cost analysis, and operational governance. The substrate defines the contracts a provider must honor.

### 7.1 Provider Capacity Model

UDLM defines three capacity information modes. Mode 3 is mandatory for all providers. Modes 1 and 2 are configurable per provider registration.

**Mode 1 — Dynamic Query (on-demand)**
The realization queries the provider for current capacity as part of request processing. Used when real-time accuracy is critical or when the provider cannot maintain a registration schedule.

```yaml
capacity_query_response:
  provider_uuid: <uuid>
  resource_type_uuid: <uuid>
  location_uuid: <uuid>
  query_timestamp: <ISO 8601>
  available_capacity: <units>
  reserved_capacity: <units>
  committed_capacity: <units>
  sovereignty_capabilities: <list>
```

**Mode 2 — Provider Registration (scheduled, preferred)**
Provider registers capacity data with the realization on a configurable schedule. The realization maintains an internal capacity rating per provider, per Resource Type, per location. Default minimum update frequency: twice daily. Update frequency is configurable per provider registration.

```yaml
capacity_registration:
  provider_uuid: <uuid>
  registration_timestamp: <ISO 8601>
  next_scheduled_registration: <ISO 8601>
  capacity_by_resource_type:
    - resource_type_uuid: <uuid>
      location_uuid: <uuid>
      available_capacity: <units>
      reserved_capacity: <units>
      committed_capacity: <units>
      sovereignty_capabilities: <list>
```

**Mode 3 — Provider Denial (reactive, mandatory)**
The provider validates it can fulfill a request before executing. If it cannot, it denies the request with reason `INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`. The realization receives the denial and can retry with an alternative provider. The denial triggers an immediate update to the realization's internal capacity rating for that provider.

```yaml
provider_denial:
  provider_uuid: <uuid>
  request_uuid: <uuid>
  denial_reason: INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES
  denial_timestamp: <ISO 8601>
  resource_type_uuid: <uuid>
  location_uuid: <uuid>
  estimated_available_at: <ISO 8601 — optional, if provider can estimate>
```

### 7.2 Provider Lifecycle Events

Any provider event that affects Resource/Service Entity availability or operational characteristics MUST be reported to the realization immediately. Providers have a contractual obligation to report these events — this is non-negotiable.

**Reportable Event Types (closed substrate vocabulary):**

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `CAPACITY_CHANGE` | Available capacity increased or decreased |
| `DEGRADATION` | Underlying resource is degraded |
| `MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULED` | Planned maintenance window declared |
| `MAINTENANCE_STARTED` | Maintenance has begun |
| `MAINTENANCE_COMPLETED` | Maintenance completed |
| `UNSANCTIONED_CHANGE` | Change occurred that was not initiated by the realization |
| `ENTITY_HEALTH_CHANGE` | Entity health status changed |
| `PROVIDER_DEGRADATION` | Provider itself is degraded |
| `DECOMMISSION_NOTICE` | Provider is decommissioning underlying resource |

**Event Payload Format (substrate-normative):**
All provider lifecycle events must be reported in unified data model format:

```yaml
provider_lifecycle_event:
  event_uuid: <uuid>
  event_type: <one of the types above>
  provider_uuid: <uuid>
  affected_entity_uuids:
    - <uuid of affected Resource/Service Entity>
  event_timestamp: <ISO 8601>
  event_details:
    <event-specific data in unified format>
  severity: <INFO|WARNING|CRITICAL>
  requires_immediate_action: <true|false>
```

**Maximum Reporting Latency:**
Providers must report lifecycle events within the timeframe declared in their provider registration. For CRITICAL severity events, immediate reporting is required. The reporting latency SLA is part of the Provider SLA/Operational Contract.

### 7.3 Capacity Rating Contract

The realization maintains an internal capacity rating per provider, per Resource Type, per location. This rating is used by placement logic. The substrate defines the rating data structure; specific freshness thresholds may be realization-configurable.

```yaml
capacity_rating:
  provider_uuid: <uuid>
  resource_type_uuid: <uuid>
  location_uuid: <uuid>
  last_updated: <ISO 8601>
  update_source: <mode_1_query|mode_2_registration|mode_3_denial>
  available_capacity: <units>
  capacity_confidence: <high|medium|low>
  # high: updated within last scheduled window
  # medium: updated within 2x scheduled window
  # low: stale — beyond 2x scheduled window
  next_scheduled_update: <ISO 8601>
```

## 7a. Provider Update Notification Model

### 7a.1 The Fundamental Constraint — Realized State Only Changes via a Request

UDLM enforces a single foundational rule for the Realized Store:

> **Realized State only changes when an authorized request produces a corresponding Requested State record. No exceptions.**

This constraint unifies all state change pathways and eliminates ambiguity:

- **Drift is always unsanctioned** — if Discovered State differs from Realized State and there is no corresponding Requested State record explaining the difference, it is drift. There is no such thing as "legitimate drift."
- **Discovery does not update Realized State** — discovery writes only to the Discovered Store. It never updates the Realized Store, even if discovery shows an authorized change (the authorization produces its own Requested State and Realized State records).
- **Providers cannot write directly to Realized State** — providers report changes via the Provider Update Notification contract. The realization evaluates the notification and creates a Requested State record if approved. Only then does a new Realized State record get written.

### 7a.2 Provider Update Notification

A **Provider Update Notification** is the formal mechanism by which a Service Provider reports an authorized state change. This is distinct from a lifecycle event (which reports provider health) and distinct from an unsanctioned change (which triggers drift). A Provider Update Notification is the provider saying: "I made an authorized change to this entity — please record it as the new Realized State."

**When is a Provider Update Notification appropriate:**

| Scenario | Correct mechanism | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Provider auto-heals a failed disk | Provider Update Notification | Authorized maintenance action; new disk is the correct state |
| Provider scales resources per pre-authorized auto-scale policy | Provider Update Notification | The realization pre-authorized the scaling policy; each scaling event is an authorized change |
| Provider performs planned maintenance that changes an IP assignment | Provider Update Notification | Planned, coordinated change |
| Unauthorized human modifies VM configuration at provider console | Drift event | No realization authorization; treated as unsanctioned change |
| Provider silently changes configuration without notifying the realization | Drift event (detected by discovery) | Unreported change is unsanctioned until evaluated |

### 7a.3 Provider Update Notification Contract

Service Providers submit update notifications via a dedicated endpoint on the realization's API surface. The wire payload is normative:

```
POST /api/v1/provider/entities/{entity_uuid}/update-notification
Authorization: <provider auth credential per provider-callback-auth contract>

Request body:
{
  "provider_uuid": "<uuid>",
  "notification_uuid": "<uuid>",      # idempotency key
  "notification_type": "<authorized_change|maintenance_change|auto_scale>",
  "changed_fields": {
    "memory_gb": {
      "previous_value": 8,
      "new_value": 16,
      "change_reason": "Auto-scale policy: payments-api-scale-up triggered at 85% memory utilization",
      "authorizing_policy_ref": "<uuid of pre-authorized policy>"
    }
  },
  "effective_at": "<ISO 8601>",
  "provider_evidence_ref": "<provider-side reference for this change>"
}
```

### 7a.4 Notification Outcomes (Closed Vocabulary)

The substrate defines the closed outcome vocabulary for Provider Update Notifications. The realization evaluates the notification against policy and returns one of:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `REJECTED` | The change is not authorized. Realized State is NOT updated. The discrepancy becomes drift. The provider receives a rejection response. |
| `REQUIRES_CONSUMER_APPROVAL` | The change is plausible but requires consumer sign-off. The entity enters a pending-review state. The provider receives a "pending_approval" response. |
| `APPROVED` | The realization creates a Requested State record (source_type: provider_update) and writes a new Realized State snapshot referencing the new Requested State. |

### 7a.5 Pre-Authorization of Provider Updates (Contract)

Categories of provider updates can be pre-authorized through policy, eliminating the need for per-change human approval. The substrate provides the policy declaration shape:

```yaml
policy:
  type: gatekeeper
  handle: "tenant/payments/allow-auto-scale"
  rules:
    - condition:
        notification_type: auto_scale
        provider_uuid: <approved-provider-uuid>
        entity.resource_type: Compute.VirtualMachine
        changed_fields: [memory_gb, cpu_count]
        change_within_bounds:
          memory_gb: { max_increase_factor: 2 }
          cpu_count: { max_increase_factor: 2 }
      action: approve
      audit_note: "Auto-scale approved per payments team scaling policy"
```

This pre-authorization pattern allows providers to implement auto-scaling, auto-healing, and maintenance operations without requiring per-change manual approval while keeping the Realized Store accurate and traceable.

### 7a.6 Mechanism Mapping (Substrate Table)

| Event Type | Mechanism | Realized Store Updated? |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| `CAPACITY_CHANGE` | Lifecycle event | No |
| `DEGRADATION` | Lifecycle event | No |
| `MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULED` | Lifecycle event | No |
| `MAINTENANCE_CHANGE` | **Provider Update Notification** | Yes (if approved) |
| `AUTO_SCALE` | **Provider Update Notification** | Yes (if approved) |
| `AUTO_HEAL` | **Provider Update Notification** | Yes (if approved) |
| `UNSANCTIONED_CHANGE` | Lifecycle event (no notification) | No (drift, not update) |
| `ENTITY_HEALTH_CHANGE` | Lifecycle event | No |
| `DECOMMISSION_NOTICE` | Lifecycle event | No |

### 7a.7 System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `RSE-010` | Realized State only changes via an authorized request that produces a corresponding Requested State record. Drift detection, discovery cycles, and lifecycle events do not write to the Realized Store. |
| `RSE-011` | Provider Update Notifications are evaluated by the Policy Engine before any Realized State change. Rejected notifications do not update Realized State — the discrepancy becomes drift. |
| `RSE-012` | Categories of provider updates may be pre-authorized via GateKeeper policy. Pre-authorized updates are processed automatically without per-change human approval. |
| `RSE-013` | Provider Update Notifications that require consumer approval place the entity in PENDING_REVIEW state. The provider receives a "pending_approval" response and the change is queued until resolution. |

---

### 7c. Provider Accreditation Registration

Every Service Provider must declare its accreditation status during registration. Accreditation declarations are references to accreditation records registered in the accreditation registry (see [Accreditation and Authorization Matrix](../governance/accreditation-and-authorization-matrix.md)).

```yaml
provider_registration:
  # ... existing fields ...
  accreditations:
    - accreditation_uuid: <uuid>       # reference to registered accreditation record
      framework: fedramp_high
      status: active
      expires_at: "2026-12-31"

    - accreditation_uuid: <uuid>
      framework: hipaa
      accreditation_type: baa
      status: active

  # Self-declared compliance (lowest trust; used when no formal accreditation exists)
  self_declared_compliance:
    frameworks: [iso_27001]
    last_self_review: "2026-01-15"
    evidence_ref: <url>

  # Maximum data classification this provider is permitted to handle
  # The realization computes this from active accreditations; self_declared_max is the fallback
  self_declared_max_data_classification: confidential
```

Providers without any accreditation records are treated as `self_declared` level and are subject to the most restrictive authorization matrix rules. They may only receive data classified as `public` or `internal`.

---

## 8. Entity Relationships

Every Resource/Service Entity carries a `relationships` section declaring its relationships to other entities — internal entities, external data entities, and business context entities. The relationship model is universal — the same structure is used for all relationship types.

See [Entity Relationships](entity-relationships.md) for the complete relationship model.

```yaml
resource_service_entity:
  uuid: <uuid>
  # ... other entity fields ...
  relationships:
    - relationship_uuid: <uuid — same on both sides>
      this_entity_uuid: <this entity's uuid>
      this_role: <role this entity plays>
      related_entity_uuid: <uuid of related entity or external reference>
      related_entity_type: <internal|external>
      relationship_type: <requires|depends_on|contains|references|peer|manages>
      nature: <constituent|operational|informational>
      lifecycle_policy:
        on_related_destroy: <destroy|retain|detach|notify>
        on_related_suspend: <suspend|retain|detach|notify>
        on_related_modify: <cascade|ignore|notify>
      status: <active|suspended|terminated>
      provenance:
        <standard provenance metadata>
```

---

## 9. UDLM System Policies for Resource/Service Entities

The following are **non-overridable UDLM substrate policies** that apply to all Resource/Service Entities. Any conformant realization MUST enforce these:

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `RSE-001` | Every Resource/Service Entity must belong to exactly one Tenant. |
| `RSE-002` | Every Resource/Service Entity must have a UUID. |
| `RSE-003` | Every Resource/Service Entity must have a complete provenance chain. |
| `RSE-004` | Realized State payloads must be complete — not a status code. |
| `RSE-005` | Decommissioned Entity records are immutable and permanent. |
| `RSE-006` | Provider lifecycle events must be recorded in Entity provenance. |
| `RSE-007` | Ownership transfers must be authorized by policy. |
| `RSE-008` | Process Resource Entities must reference all affected Entity UUIDs. |

---

## 9a. Lifecycle Time Constraints

### 9a.1 Concept

**Lifecycle time constraints** declare when a resource should cease to exist or trigger a lifecycle action. They are a first-class field on any resource entity — governed, provenance-tracked, and subject to the standard override control model.

Any source in the data model precedence chain can declare a time constraint: a consumer request, a Core Layer, a Service Layer, or a policy. The Policy Engine has full authority over constraints — a GateKeeper can lock a TTL immutable or set `immutable_ceiling: absolute` on an expiry date.

### 9a.2 Constraint Structure

```yaml
lifecycle_constraints:
  ttl:
    duration: P14D                            # ISO 8601 duration
    reference_point: realization_timestamp    # created_at | realization_timestamp | last_modified
    on_expiry: <destroy | suspend | notify | review>
    metadata:
      override: allow                         # standard override control
      basis_for_value: "Consumer declared ephemeral — 14-day lab resource"

  expires_at:
    timestamp: "2026-06-30T23:59:59Z"         # absolute calendar date
    on_expiry: notify
    metadata:
      override: immutable
      locked_by_policy_uuid: <uuid>
      basis_for_value: "Project deadline — resource must not persist beyond Q2"

  enforcement:
    warn_before_expiry: P1D                   # warn 1 day before expiry
    grace_period: PT1H                        # 1 hour grace after expiry before action
    on_grace_period_expiry: <execute | escalate>
```

When both `ttl` and `expires_at` are declared, the earliest expiry wins (LTC-004).

### 9a.3 Precedence

Time constraints follow the same precedence as all other resource fields:

```
Base Layer (lowest — e.g., no TTL by default)
  ↓  Core Layer (e.g., all dev resources: TTL 90 days)
  ↓  Service Layer (e.g., ephemeral compute: TTL 7 days)
  ↓  Request Layer (consumer declared)
  ↓  Transformation Policy (enrich from business context)
  ↓  GateKeeper Policy (highest — may lock immutable)
```

### 9a.4 Expiry Enforcement Contract

The substrate requires that a conformant realization provide a Lifecycle Constraint Enforcer (or equivalent) that monitors realized entities, fires `on_expiry` actions when constraints are reached, and records all enforcement in provenance and the Audit Store. Entities whose `on_expiry` action fails to execute MUST enter `PENDING_EXPIRY_ACTION` state and trigger an escalation (LTC-005). The mechanism by which this enforcement is implemented is a realization choice.

### 9a.5 System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `LTC-001` | Lifecycle time constraints follow standard data model precedence. |
| `LTC-002` | GateKeeper policies may lock lifecycle constraints as immutable. |
| `LTC-003` | Expiry enforcement is a substrate-required control plane function. |
| `LTC-004` | When multiple time constraints exist, the earliest expiry wins. |
| `LTC-005` | Failed expiry action execution triggers `PENDING_EXPIRY_ACTION` state and escalation. |

## 9a-process. Lifecycle Time Constraints — Process Resources

Process Resource entities must declare a maximum execution time. This is a mandatory field — not optional. A Process Resource with no execution time limit creates operational blindness (the realization cannot know if it is hung).

```yaml
process_resource_entity:
  resource_type: Process.AnsiblePlaybook
  execution_constraints:
    max_execution_time: PT2H          # mandatory — ISO 8601 duration
    expected_completion: PT30M        # advisory — when we expect completion
    grace_period: PT15M               # grace period after max before action fires
    on_max_exceeded: <escalate|terminate|notify>
    # escalate:  notify platform admin and provider; human decides
    # terminate: instruct provider to terminate the process
    # notify:    notify consumer and wait; no automatic action
    escalation_recipient: <actor-uuid>
```

Process execution time is a `lifecycle_constraint.ttl` with `reference_point: realization_timestamp`. The `on_max_exceeded` action maps to the standard `on_expiry` lifecycle action vocabulary.

Profile-governed defaults for `on_max_exceeded` are realization-configurable; the substrate requires that profiles in the stricter direction (e.g., `fsi`, `sovereign`) default to deterministic termination, while looser profiles MAY default to `notify`.

---

## 9b. Billing State and SUSPENDED Entities

The substrate carries billing state as a first-class field. A consuming cost-analysis component reads this field. Organizations declare billing behavior via policy — the substrate does not decide what is billable.

```yaml
entity:
  lifecycle_state: SUSPENDED
  billing_state: <billable|non_billable|reduced_rate>
  billing_metadata:
    billing_rate_multiplier: 0.3       # 30% of normal rate if reduced_rate
    billing_reason: "Reserved capacity — suspended but resources held"
    billing_policy_uuid: <uuid>        # policy that determined this billing state
    billable_components: [storage, ip_address]   # which sub-resources are billed
    non_billable_components: [compute]
```

**Three billing models for SUSPENDED (closed vocabulary):**
- **`billable`** — resources reserved and capacity held (stopped VM still consuming reserved IP and storage)
- **`non_billable`** — resources fully released on suspension (spot/ephemeral resource)
- **`reduced_rate`** — partial resources held (storage retained, compute released)

Policy injects `billing_state` and `billing_metadata` during state transitions.

---

## 9c. Bare Metal Indivisibility

Bare metal Whole Allocation uses the same `shareability.allowed: false` mechanism as any non-shareable resource (REL-017), plus an explicit `allocation_model` declaration:

```yaml
resource_type_spec:
  fully_qualified_name: Compute.BareMetal
  allocation_model: whole_unit         # whole_unit | fractional | pooled
  shareability:
    allowed: false                     # structural lock — cannot be changed by policy
    indivisibility_reason: "Physical hardware — cannot be partitioned"
  capacity:
    unit: server
    minimum_allocation: 1
    maximum_allocation: 1              # whole unit only

# Provider contract obligations for bare metal:
provider_contract_obligations:
  - Report full physical identity in realized payload (serial_number, hardware_profile)
  - Exclusive placement hold during reserve_query — no concurrent holds on same server
  - Notify immediately if any sharing attempt is detected (drift trigger)
```

---

## 9d. Capacity Confidence — Automatic Actions

Capacity confidence ratings trigger policy-governed automatic actions. Policy determines the action per confidence level. The substrate defines the closed action vocabulary; specific defaults per profile are realization-configurable.

```yaml
capacity_confidence_policy:
  HIGH:
    action: proceed
    max_data_age: PT5M
  MEDIUM:
    action: proceed_with_warning      # default — overridable by policy
    max_data_age: PT30M
  LOW:
    action: refresh_before_placement  # default — trigger Mode 1 query
    max_data_age: PT1H
    trigger_mode1_query: true
```

Closed action vocabulary: `proceed`, `proceed_with_warning`, `refresh_before_placement`, `reject`.

---

## 9e. Ownership Transfer Count

Ownership transfers are unlimited by default. Each transfer is immutably recorded with a monotonically incrementing `transfer_number`. Policy may declare a maximum per resource type.

```yaml
ownership_transfer_record:
  transfer_uuid: <uuid>
  transfer_number: 3              # monotonically incrementing — never resets
  from_tenant_uuid: <uuid>
  to_tenant_uuid: <uuid>
  authorized_by: <actor>
  transfer_timestamp: <ISO 8601>
  reason: <human-readable — mandatory>
  policy_uuid: <uuid>
```

Policy-governed maximum when needed:
```yaml
policy:
  type: gatekeeper
  rule: >
    If resource.ownership_transfer_count > 5
    AND resource_type == Compute.VirtualMachine
    THEN gatekeep: "VM has exceeded 5 ownership transfers — manual review required"
```

## 10. UDLM System Policies — Entity and Dependency Gaps

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `ENT-001` | Ownership transfer count is unlimited by default. Policy may declare a maximum transfer count per resource type. Each transfer is immutably recorded with a monotonically incrementing transfer_number and mandatory reason field. |
| `ENT-002` | Bare metal resources declare `allocation_model: whole_unit` and `shareability.allowed: false`. Placement holds are exclusive. Providers must report the server's physical identity in the realized payload and notify of any sharing attempt. |
| `ENT-003` | Capacity confidence ratings trigger policy-governed automatic actions. LOW confidence triggers a Mode 1 Information Provider query by default in standard+ profiles. Profile determines the default action per confidence level. |
| `ENT-004` | Process Resource entities must declare `max_execution_time`. This field is mandatory. Execution time is enforced by the substrate-required Lifecycle Constraint Enforcer. Profile governs the default `on_max_exceeded` action. |
| `ENT-005` | Entity `billing_state` (billable, non_billable, or reduced_rate) is a first-class field injected by policy during state transitions. A consuming cost-analysis component reads `billing_state` for cost attribution. The substrate does not decide billing policy — it carries the billing signal. |

- **Tenant** — the mandatory ownership boundary for all Resource/Service Entities
- **Four States** — Intent, Requested, Realized, Discovered — the state lifecycle of a Resource/Service Request and Entity
- **Field-Level Provenance** — every state transition and ownership transfer is recorded in Entity provenance
- **Policy Engine** — evaluates provider events and unsanctioned changes, determines response actions
- **Service Dependencies** — Resource/Service Entities declare dependencies on other Entities
- **Resource Grouping** — Entities belong to a Tenant and optionally to additional Resource Groups
- **Provider Contract** — governs provider obligations including capacity reporting and event notification
