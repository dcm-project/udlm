# Worked example: a single-VM workload as a Composite — VM, address, derived DNS, day-0 job

**What this settles:** how a complete small workload — one VM on an isolated segment with a
static address, DNS records, and a post-provision job — is authored as intent. The source
material is a real, working provisioning playbook (anonymized): ~200 lines of imperative
shell across three plays. The intent document below carries the same workload in ~60 lines,
and improves on the playbook in three places the comparison table calls out.

The workload: a game-server VM on a DMZ segment. 8 vCPU, 32 GiB, one 128 GB disk, a current
Fedora Server guest, a static address on an isolated VLAN the host itself holds no address
on, forward and reverse DNS, and a first-boot job that grows the root filesystem into the
full disk.

## What the intent version improves over the playbook

| Playbook | Intent |
|---|---|
| DNS play hand-authors A+PTR with the address repeated as a literal — drift is one edit away | `workload-dns` **binds** to `game-vm`'s declared `primary_ip` output; the record cannot disagree with the realized address |
| Image discovered at runtime by fetching and grepping the release directory (respins rename the file) | the `os_image` reference resolves at realization — the vocabulary entry owns "current", the intent stays stable |
| Disk placed by literal filesystem path, with a comment noting the intended future migration | `storage_class` carries the tier intent; the migration is a one-line spec edit with version history |

Provider mechanics in the playbook — hypervisor package install, bridge/VLAN plumbing on the
host, image download, guest customization, the create command — are exactly the implementation a
VM provider owns. The host-side segment plumbing is modeled once (the host's bridge and bond
as `Hardware.NetworkInterface` records with `parent_device`), not re-created per workload.

## What the source playbook exposed as model gaps

Probing this playbook against the registry surfaced four intent elements the model cannot yet
carry — each filed for a ruling rather than silently dropped: a vCPU hot-resize ceiling
(`vcpus 8, max 16`), CPU passthrough mode, day-0 management-access bootstrap (an injected SSH
key), and thin-provisioning intent for the disk. The example above expresses everything else;
those four ride their issues.
