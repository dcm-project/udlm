# Worked example — one Pool type, three RAID implementations

**What this settles:** the same `Storage.Pool` shape modeling a ZFS pool, an md boot mirror, and a
hardware-RAID virtual disk declared at bare-metal provision time — one reusable redundancy model,
native vocabulary kept authoritative, canonical mapping for cross-backend queries.

## 1. ZFS (the shape's origin)

```yaml
resource_type: Storage.Pool
spec:
  pool_kind: zfs
  vdevs:
    - type: raidz2                 # native term, authoritative
      raid_type: RAID6             # canonical mapping: RAID6-CLASS tolerance, not "is RAID6"
      members: [sd-a, sd-b, sd-c, sd-d, sd-e, sd-f]   # References -> Hardware.StorageDevice
    - type: mirror
      raid_type: RAID1
      members: [nvme-a, nvme-b]
```

## 2. mdraid (an OS boot mirror)

```yaml
spec:
  pool_kind: md
  vdevs:
    - type: raid1
      raid_type: RAID1
      members: [nvme0, nvme1]      # the md array IS one vdev; datasets above are LVM LVs
```

## 2a. raid10 — one topology, both personas

The vdev tree is recursive (members are drives **or child vdevs**), so composed layouts model
faithfully in either idiom:

```yaml
# ZFS persona — the pool stripes across top-level vdevs implicitly (zpool semantics):
spec:
  pool_kind: zfs
  vdevs:
    - {type: mirror, raid_type: RAID1, members: [sd-a, sd-b]}
    - {type: mirror, raid_type: RAID1, members: [sd-c, sd-d]}
  # [mirror, mirror] at top level IS raid10 — no explicit stripe wrapper, exactly as zpool models it.
  # NOTE: implicit top-level striping is ZFS's aggregation semantic. lvm allocates per VG policy;
  # a hardware controller doesn't aggregate independent VDs — two independent VDs = two Pools.

# Hardware-RAID persona — the controller's explicit stripe-of-mirrors tree:
spec:
  pool_kind: hardware_raid
  vdevs:
    - type: raid10
      raid_type: RAID10
      members:
        - {type: mirror, raid_type: RAID1, members: [ctrl-disk-0, ctrl-disk-1]}
        - {type: mirror, raid_type: RAID1, members: [ctrl-disk-2, ctrl-disk-3]}
  # ...and a mirror-of-stripes (raid01) is the same tree with the layers swapped.
```

`fault_tolerance_remaining` composes through the tree — min across striped children, per-group
survivability within mirrors — so both personas report the same honest number.

## 3. Hardware RAID — declared as intent, built at provision

```yaml
# contained_by -> the Compute.BareMetalHost; lifecycle Intent BEFORE the host provisions
spec:
  pool_kind: hardware_raid
  vdevs:
    - type: raid10
      raid_type: RAID10
      members: [ctrl-disk-0, ctrl-disk-1, ctrl-disk-2, ctrl-disk-3]
```

The bare-metal provisioning provider (Metal3/BMC-class) derives its controller configuration FROM
this declared pool — the host type carries no RAID fields (see Compute.BareMetalHost 0.6.0's
provisioning-intent surface: image/root-hints/boot, with storage topology living here).

## Hot spares — scope by tree position

```yaml
# Pool-wide spares (ZFS spares / controller global) — a top-level spare group:
vdevs:
  - {type: raidz2, raid_type: RAID6, members: [sd-a, sd-b, sd-c, sd-d, sd-e, sd-f]}
  - {type: spare, members: [sd-g, sd-h]}          # claimable by any protected vdev in the pool

# Dedicated spare (mdadm per-array / controller dedicated) — nested inside the vdev it serves:
vdevs:
  - type: mirror
    raid_type: RAID1
    members:
      - nvme0
      - nvme1
      - {type: spare, members: [nvme2]}           # standby for THIS mirror only

# draid — spare capacity is woven in; no physical spare device:
vdevs:
  - {type: draid, distributed_spares: 2, members: [sd-a, sd-b, sd-c, sd-d, sd-e, sd-f, sd-g, sd-h]}
```

A controller's **global** spare serving several virtual disks (= several Pools) appears in each
pool's spare group: exclusivity applies to *active* membership only; standby claims resolve
first-come, as the hardware behaves. `spares_available` is its own output — a spare restores
tolerance after resilver, it never adds tolerance now, so it is deliberately not folded into
`fault_tolerance_remaining`.

## What every backend gets for free

- **Blast radius as a graph walk:** members are References to `Hardware.StorageDevice` — a dead
  drive's inbound edges are the affected vdevs, whose pools, whose datasets.
- **Degradation as drift:** `redundancy_status` and `fault_tolerance_remaining` outputs — a
  degraded mirror publishes `fault_tolerance_remaining: 0`, the number an operator acts on.
- **Cross-backend queries:** `raid_type` (Swordfish RAIDType) answers "everything with ≥2-failure
  tolerance" across firmware, md, and zpool alike — while `type` never lies about what it natively is.
