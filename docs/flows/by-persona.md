# Flows by persona — how each role uses the system

**What this settles:** the 21 September-release use cases, grouped by the
**persona** who drives them — a usage view of the system, one role at a time. Every entry is a **lighter**
flow that builds on [request-realization](request-realization.md); read that first. Each flow has a
**stage** (in croadfeldt/udlm — the model's telling) and a **play** (in croadfeldt/dcm — the engine's
telling); the links below resolve to the docs in *this* repo.

## application-team-member — request and consume resources
The everyday consumer: asks for what they need in portable terms and lets the system realize it.

## platform-operator — model, register, and operate the estate
Runs the substrate: models resources and their dependency graph, registers providers, keeps ordering sound.

## platform-engineer — day-2: rehydration, drift, policy, profiles
Owns the running system: recovery, drift, policy overrides, and how profiles resolve.

## compliance-auditor / auditor — provenance and cryptographic audit
Verifies what happened: field-level provenance and tamper-evident proofs.

## solution-architect — decompose an architecture into resources
Turns a whole architecture into ordered, dependency-aware resource requests.
