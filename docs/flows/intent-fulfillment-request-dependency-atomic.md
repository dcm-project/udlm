# Request dependency, atomic — the stage

**What this settles:** how a **request**-nature coupling makes a set of peers atomic — the ten-VMs
all-or-none case — without an `atomic` flag. A request dependency binds at the Intent/Requested
layer ("I want these as a unit"), and that single binding yields both atomic faces: **hold-all**
(none activates until all can) and **cancel-all** (a permanent shortfall cancels the unit). It
builds on [request-realization](request-realization.md) and ADR-011's reservation-not-activation,
and stages the request-mutual rows of
[`intent-fulfillment-model.md`](../design/intent-fulfillment-model.md).

> **Use Case:** `intent-fulfillment/request-dependency-atomic`. **Persona:** platform-engineer ·
> **Profile:** standard.

**In one breath.** Ten peer VMs are coupled by a request dependency — mutual, non-directional,
distinct from an operational "can't function without." One VM cannot be satisfied. While the window
is open, the **whole unit is held**: every member sits at Requested, reserved where possible
(ADR-011 — reservation is not activation), and no VM goes live. If the blocked member converges,
all ten activate atomically. If it is permanently unsatisfiable, the **whole coupled request
cancels** and none goes live. Hold-all up and cancel-all down are the one behavior of the request
nature. The surface names the blocking member and that the coupling binds the unit.

## The flow — only what's different

```mermaid

    participant C as Consumer
    participant P as Platform (reconciler)
    participant U as Request unit (10 peer VMs)
    C->>P: Intent (VM1..VM10 coupled by a request dependency)
    P->>U: reserve each member where possible (ADR-011)
    Note over U: members held at Requested — reservation is NOT activation
    alt one member transiently unsatisfiable, window open
        P-->>C: WARNING — unit held (hold-all), names blocking member
        U-->>P: member converges to all can reserve
        P->>U: activate ALL atomically (Requested to Realized)
        U-->>C: unit Realized (none ahead of the others)
    else member permanently unsatisfiable (or window expires)
        P->>U: cancel-all — release every reservation
        Note over U: no member Realized
        P-->>C: REFUSAL-with-resolution — names member + the request coupling
    end
```

## Invariants

- **One binding, two faces.** Hold-all activation and cancel-all failure both come from the request
  nature — there is no separate `atomic` flag.
- **Reservation is not activation.** A member that reserved early is never left running while its
  siblings are held; activation happens once, for all, together (ADR-011).
- **Held at Requested, activated to Realized as a unit.** The request coupling binds at the
  Requested layer; the atomic transition is to Realized.
- **The window decides how long to hold.** `w=0` cancels the unit at once; `w=N` holds then cancels
  at expiry; `w=∞` holds indefinitely. Permanence cancels regardless of `w`.

## What UDLM does not decide

The window value, and the mechanics of a clean cancel-all (releasing reservations, any rollback of
side effects) — DCM policy over the coupling and statuses UDLM declares (ADR-008). UDLM owns the
request nature, the hold-all/cancel-all propagation semantics, and the reservation contract.

## Data · Policy · Provider (required lens — SPEC-DESIGN §29)

- **Data:** the request dependency binding the peers; members held at Requested; the atomic
  transition to Realized.
- **Policy:** request nature yields hold-all (up) and cancel-all (down) from one binding.
- **Provider:** reserves each member (ADR-011); no reservation becomes an activation until all can.
