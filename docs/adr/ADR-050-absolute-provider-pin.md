# UDLM ADR-050: The absolute provider pin — whether a pin may confer eligibility, or only express preference

**Status:** Proposed (croadfeldt upstream) — pending engineering ratification (#217); **decided 2026-07-28 (maintainer, ADR-008 peer test): the ceiling is a UDLM invariant; whether a pin may bypass it is an operational policy — a DCM obligation, tracked in the DCM policy-obligations register.** The option catalogue below is *informative* — the policy shapes DCM may adopt, not a choice UDLM makes.
**Date:** 2026-07-25
**Type:** Architecture Decision Record (a `DecisionRecord`, architecture scope)
**Background — read first (the cold reader's on-ramp; skip if you have the context).** Each cited
once with what it settles. `contracts/provider-contract.md` — **PRV-009** (default-deny:
`effective_capabilities` is the intersecting ceiling, never invoked outside) + **PRV-011** (the
dispatch-boundary check this ADR shapes). ADR-004 — capability declaration (declare-and-select; an
undeclared capability found only at runtime is rejected). `contracts/error-model.md` §3.2 —
`placement.capability_mismatch` (already in the closed vocabulary, distinct from `provider.*`; the
type exists, the enforcement point does not). `contracts/policy-contract.md` §18 — the override
model (an override is a data record with approval + audit; the precedent Option B reuses).
[`use-cases/must-reject/005-provider-capability-mismatch-refused.yaml`](../../use-cases/must-reject/005-provider-capability-mismatch-refused.yaml)
— the case that measures this, the one refusal case where the model *specifies* the hazard rather
than omitting the guard.

## Context

Declare-and-select is one of the model's load-bearing commitments. A provider declares what it
can do; an administrator admits some subset; the registry and the governance matrix narrow it
further; the intersection is the provider's effective capability set, and the contract says a
provider can never be invoked outside it. Eligibility is settled from declarations, not
discovered by trying.

The commitment is undermined by a mechanism that exists for good reasons. Placement supports a
pinned provider — an administrator or policy names the target directly — and the pin is specified
as *absolute*: it short-circuits the remaining steps of the placement algorithm, which include
the accreditation filter and the capability filter. Only the sovereignty pre-filter survives it.
Read together with the ceiling, the two texts contradict: one says a provider can never be
invoked outside its effective capabilities, the other describes a path that reaches dispatch
without consulting them. Where a specification contradicts itself, the operational text wins, and
here the operational text is the one that describes the algorithm.

The consequence is not theoretical. A stale routing rule or a mistaken pin sends work to a
provider that never declared for the resource type, the dispatch is attempted, and the provider
fails at something it never claimed to support. The operator sees a provider error and
investigates a provider that is working correctly; the actual fault — a routing mistake — is
invisible in the symptom. The provider may also have done partial work before failing, so a
misconfiguration becomes a cleanup. This is refusal-by-attempt, and it is the specific behavior
the must-reject case forbids: a capability mismatch is an eligibility fact known before dispatch,
and reporting it as a provider failure mistypes it.

Two things are worth saying about the pin before proposing to change it, because it is not a
mistake. Pinning solves real problems — migration to a specific target, an operator working
around a placement heuristic, a policy that must route a class of work to a named provider — and
a pin that quietly loses to a scoring function is its own kind of failure. Any change must
preserve the operator's ability to name a target and have that honored. And the corpus is not
yet self-consistent about the typing either: a sibling placement case classifies the same
scenario as a provider failure where the must-reject case classifies it as a policy violation.
That disagreement should be resolved by the same ruling.

## Decision

**UDLM holds the ceiling; whether a pin may bypass it is policy.** The peer test (ADR-008) settles it:
whether an operator may deliberately dispatch outside a provider's declared capabilities is an
operational choice a conformant implementation is *entitled* to make differently — so it is not a substrate
law. What UDLM fixes is the invariant a bypass would be an exception *to*.

**The UDLM invariant** (`PRV-009`/`PRV-011`, restated, not new): the `effective_capabilities` ceiling
**always applies at the dispatch boundary, on every path**. A pin is therefore **preference among eligible
providers** — it decides *which* eligible provider, never *whether* an ineligible one is reached. A pin
naming an ineligible provider yields `placement.capability_mismatch` **before dispatch**, carrying the
required-versus-declared comparison. The pin stays absolute over the *choice*; it is not absolute over
*capability*. This makes one sentence true everywhere instead of true-with-an-exception.

**Delegated to policy (a DCM obligation).** A *deliberate* eligibility bypass — the genuine case of a
provider that can do the work but never declared it — is not forbidden; it is **priced as policy**,
through the existing override-record flow (an approver, a reason, a scope, a time bound —
`policy-contract.md` §18). No new mechanism: an override is already a first-class, approved, audited data
record. UDLM does **not** bake an absolute-bypass into the model, and does not choose whether a given
profile permits the override at all — that is DCM's policy call. **This is registered as a DCM policy
item** (see *Delegated work* below).

**The corpus typing, settled by the same ruling:** a capability mismatch is a `policy_violation`
(`placement.capability_mismatch`) — an eligibility fact known *before* dispatch — never a `provider.*`
failure. The provider did not break; it was never eligible.

### Shape A — Preference-only, no policy bypass (the substrate default)

The pin selects; it does not exempt. The eligibility filters always run, and the pin decides among
what survives them. A pin naming an ineligible provider yields `placement.capability_mismatch`
before dispatch, carrying the required-versus-declared comparison.

*Why it is recommended:* it removes the contradiction rather than documenting an exception to it,
and it preserves everything the pin was for. An operator naming a provider that *can* do the work
gets exactly what they asked for, unconditionally and without a scoring function overriding them —
the pin remains absolute over the choice, which is the part operators care about. What it stops
being is absolute over *capability*, and no operator has ever wanted a dispatch to a provider
that cannot serve it; they wanted the target honored, and it still is. It also makes one sentence
true everywhere instead of true-with-an-exception, which is worth a great deal in a specification
other people implement.

*Its cost:* an operator who today pins a provider whose declaration is stale or incomplete gets a
refusal where they previously got a dispatch that happened to work. That is a real regression in
one scenario — the provider that *can* do the thing but never declared it. The honest answer is
that this scenario is a declaration defect and should surface as one, and the remedy is to fix
the declaration, which is cheap and is the mechanism the whole model rests on. But it is a
behavior change with an operational tail, and the transition deserves a deprecation window rather
than a flag day.

### Shape B — A policy bypass via an override record

The pin may bypass eligibility, but only when accompanied by an override record: an approver, a
reason, a scope, and a time bound, through the existing override-approval flow. Absent the
record, the pin is a preference and Option A's behavior applies.

*What it buys:* it keeps the escape hatch for the genuine case above — a provider that can do the
work despite its declarations — and prices it correctly. The machinery exists: the model already
treats an override as a first-class data record with approval and audit, and the regulated
profiles already require a time-bounded approval workflow for overriding hard policy. Nothing new
is invented.

*Its costs:* it concedes that the ceiling has an exception, which weakens the sentence
`PRV-009` is built on and gives every future reader a precedent to argue from. It adds an approval
step to a path that is often exercised under time pressure — migrations and incident response —
so the practical outcome may be a standing blanket override, which is the bypass with paperwork.
And it does not actually fix the underlying declaration defect; it institutionalizes working
around it.

### Shape C — Two fields (preference vs bypass)

Retire the single field in favor of two differently-named ones: one expressing preference among
eligible providers, one expressing a deliberate eligibility bypass. The name carries the
semantics, so no one is surprised by which they got.

*What it buys:* clarity at the point of authorship. A reader of a policy sees immediately whether
a bypass was intended, which today requires knowing the algorithm's step ordering. It also makes
the bypass greppable across an estate — a real auditing benefit.

*Its costs:* it is Option B with a second field instead of an approval record, and it keeps the
bypass while removing the price. Two fields also mean two code paths, two sets of documentation,
and a migration for every existing pin — the largest change surface of the three for the smallest
semantic gain. If the ruling is that a bypass must exist, Option B prices it better; if the ruling
is that it must not, Option A is simpler.

### What the ruling settles beyond the field itself

Whichever option is chosen, the same ruling should settle the corpus's typing disagreement: a
capability mismatch is an **eligibility** outcome — `placement.capability_mismatch`, refused
pre-dispatch — and not a provider failure, because the provider did not break; it was never
eligible. `provider.unavailable` and its neighbours remain reserved for providers that were
eligible and then failed.

## Delegated work — the DCM policy obligation

Registered in the DCM policy-obligations register. UDLM guarantees the ceiling; **DCM must** decide, as
policy governed by the profile:
- **whether a deliberate bypass exists at all** in a given profile, and if so its shape — the override-
  record flow (Shape B) is the priced default; the two-field split (Shape C) is an alternative DCM may
  adopt if authorship clarity outweighs the larger surface;
- **the deprecation window** for operators relying on today's absolute-pin behaviour, and the declaration-
  defect remedy (fix the stale declaration) named in the same change, so no operator's pin simply "stops
  working" without a path;
- **the placement algorithm text** that currently describes the pin as skipping the remaining steps — DCM
  amends it so the eligibility check is unconditional at the dispatch boundary.

UDLM will not accept a UC or conformance claim in which a pin reaches dispatch outside the ceiling; a
bypass is only ever a recorded, approved policy override, and its permissibility is DCM's to set per profile.

## Data · Policy · Provider

- **Data** — the provider's registration declarations and the computed `effective_capabilities`
  ceiling are both resolvable records, which is what lets the refusal cite a
  required-versus-declared comparison instead of asserting a verdict.
- **Policy** — placement, pinning, and any override are policy decisions. This ADR is a ruling
  about what policy may *not* decide: whether a dispatch happens outside the declared ceiling.
- **Provider** — the provider is the party protected by the rule. It receives no work it never
  declared for, and it is not blamed for failing at work it never claimed.

## UDLM vs DCM — what lands where (the peer test, ADR-008)

| Piece | **UDLM** — model / contract (a peer MUST honor) | **DCM** — engine / mechanism (a peer MAY differ) |
|---|---|---|
| The ceiling | `effective_capabilities` and its formula | how the intersection is computed and cached |
| Enforcement point | the check happens at the dispatch boundary, on every path (`PRV-011`) | where in the pipeline the stage sits |
| Pin semantics | whether a pin may confer eligibility — this ADR | the placement algorithm's steps and scoring |
| The refusal | `placement.capability_mismatch`, carrying required-versus-declared | the comparison's rendering |
| Override (Option B) | that a bypass is a recorded, approved, time-bounded artifact | the approval flow |

## Consequences

- The contradiction between the ceiling and the placement algorithm is resolved in one direction
  rather than left for implementers to discover. Under Option A the control-plane text describing
  the pin as skipping the remaining steps is amended; under B or C it is qualified.
- Whatever is chosen, the eligibility check must be specified as unconditional at the dispatch
  boundary. A check every path may opt out of is not a check, and the pin is only the *known*
  opt-out — routing rules and operator overrides reach dispatch the same way.
- The refusal's required-versus-declared payload has a second use beyond the immediate error: it
  distinguishes a mis-routed request (another provider is eligible) from an unsatisfiable one
  (none is), which are different problems for different people.
- If Option A is chosen, the deprecation window and the declaration-defect remedy should be named
  in the same change, so operators relying on today's behavior have a path that is not "your pin
  stopped working".

*Citation note: the pin short-circuit description cites control-plane text that lives in the
DCM repository (a cross-repo citation — it does not resolve in this tree), and the sibling
placement case with the conflicting `provider_failure` typing is in the DCM-side corpus, not
this repository's. Both were verified there; flagged so an in-tree reader does not chase them.*
