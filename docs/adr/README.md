# UDLM Architecture Decision Records

Short, reviewable records of significant UDLM data-model decisions — the **why**. Each is a
`DecisionRecord` with architecture scope (the ADR specialization — `entities/knowledge-family.md`
§4.5); UDLM **adopts the ADR/MADR format by reference**, it does not coin its own. DCM keeps its
own ADRs in `architecture/adr/` (the control-plane side); UDLM ADRs here cross-reference them.

## How these ADRs are written (the authoring standard)

An ADR is **explanation** (Diátaxis) — it justifies one decision. It is not reference (the schema)
or a tutorial (the model); it **points to** those, never reproduces them. The discipline, in order:

1. **Orient, don't educate.** A cold reader needs *where to get* foundational context, not the
   context re-taught inline. So every ADR opens with a **"Background — read first"** block: the
   docs, definitions, and prior decisions a third party must read, each cited **once with what it
   settles** (never a bare number), explicitly labeled as the on-ramp — a reader who has the context
   skips it. Foundational material is a *denoted reading path*, not inlined prose.
2. **Body is the decision.** Context (the specific forces — assumes domain literacy), Decision
   (active, one decision-area), Consequences (only the non-obvious easier/harder). Cut anything that
   doesn't move a decision; don't restate what the reader — or the ADR's own other sections —
   already said.
3. **Scope edges explicit.** A "what this does not decide" / boundary section (the UDLM/DCM split,
   ADR-008) where it applies.
4. **Immutable once Accepted.** Supersede, don't edit (the ADR-051 record discipline).

This reconciles the repo's DOC-001 *cold-reader-openable* requirement with the *writing-for-humans*
"less is more" standard: the cold reader is served by the Background on-ramp + gist-carrying
references, not by three restatements.

**Referenced DCM ADRs (external — resolve in the DCM repo `architecture/adr/`).** UDLM docs cite these
control-plane decisions by their `DCM ADR-0XX` name; they are not defined here:

| Ref | Topic (as cited in UDLM) |
|---|---|
| DCM ADR-012 | How organizational data merges with consumer requests — the assembly engine behind UDLM's layer model |
| DCM ADR-013 | Override model (control-plane side of policy override) |
| DCM ADR-014 | Layer/authority seam |
| DCM ADR-016 / 017 / 018 | Discovery/inventory control-plane decisions |
| DCM ADR-019 | Placement (the placement engine + algorithm) |
| DCM ADR-020 | Migration & operational gating — the control-plane rules that gate a workload's migration/rehydration |
| DCM ADR-022 | Trust model (DCM brokers trust, never custodies it) |
| DCM ADR-023 | Scale-of-integration / denaturalization tiers |

The local sequence below is UDLM's own — ADR-001…051 all have files here. The **DCM** ADR numbers
referenced above overlap these same integers, so a bare "ADR-014" is ambiguous between the local
ADR-014 and DCM ADR-014. Always qualify a control-plane reference as `DCM ADR-0XX` (it resolves in the
DCM repo `architecture/adr/`, not here); an unqualified `ADR-0XX` means the local file below.

**Instance-backed decision records (`ADR-<FAMILY>-NNN`).** A third namespace: decisions recorded as
machine-validated `DecisionRecord` JSON in [`registry/instances/`](../../registry/instances/), not as files
here. A reference like `ADR-PROV-004` resolves there. Current records:

| Handle | Decision | State |
|---|---|---|
| [ADR-PROV-001](../../registry/instances/adr-provider-dispatch-role.json) | Data-role classification — a provider receives execution data only; the dispatch payload is filtered by role | PROPOSED |
| [ADR-PROV-002](../../registry/instances/adr-provider-capabilities-categories.json) | Provider capabilities + capability categories — one unified declaration interface | PROPOSED |
| [ADR-PROV-003](../../registry/instances/adr-provider-capability-admission.json) | Capability admission — platform-admin disposition over a provider's *declared* capabilities (default-deny) | PROPOSED |
| [ADR-PROV-004](../../registry/instances/adr-resource-type-extension.json) | Resource-type extension model (`provider_extensions`) — additive, no-override, portability-degrading | **DEPRECATED** — superseded by ADR-038; interim carrier retiring per #202 |
| [ADR-RBAC-001](../../registry/instances/adr-dcm-rbac-function-matrix.json) | DCM RBAC — default (no-IdP) admin groups/accounts/roles + governed change | PROPOSED |
| [ADR-COST-001](../../registry/instances/adr-cost-metering-placement.json) | Metering/billing is *referenced* by UDLM, not modeled in it — cost decisions are admin policy | PROPOSED |
| [ADR-COST-002](../../registry/instances/adr-cost-metering-linkage.json) | Cost/metering linkage hooks — a reciprocal contract; the engine computes, never decides | PROPOSED |
| [ADR-AEP-001](../../registry/instances/adr-aep-alignment.json) | Adopt AEP — RFC 9457 error model + resource-oriented design + the Spectral linter | PROPOSED |
| [ADR-UDLM-DCM-001](../../registry/instances/adr-udlm-dcm-boundary.json) | UDLM = data model, DCM = implementation — runtime-architecture prose belongs in DCM (the instance record behind [ADR-008](ADR-008-udlm-dcm-boundary.md), which is authoritative) | PROPOSED |

A `PROPOSED` record binds nothing (ADR-031); rules citing one carry the proposal, not a ratified mandate.

**Required lens (every ADR / DecisionRecord).** Each decision MUST state its **Data · Policy · Provider**
aspects — the three foundational abstractions (DCM ADR-002). *Data* = what's modeled/held (UDLM);
*Policy* = what's decided/computed/governed (DCM); *Provider* = what's declared as possible and what
executes the mechanism. A decision that can't name all three (or explicitly say "n/a, because…") isn't
fully scoped. Foundational across UDLM, DCM, and DAV (`SPEC-DESIGN-REQUIREMENTS` §29).

| ADR | Decision | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| [001](ADR-001-topology-type.md) | `Topology` — cross-cutting failure/locality-domain type (failure domains = data within it; abstract `kind` / concrete `id`) | Proposed |
| [002](ADR-002-capacity-utilization-served-overlay.md) | Capacity/Utilization — served observational overlay (cost pattern), **not** a UDLM type | Proposed |
| [003](ADR-003-data-mobility-and-process-validation.md) | Data mobility (requirements=data, methods=provider, mechanism=provider, permission=Policy) + process-validation lifecycle (rehearsal/simulation, freshness; T6) | Proposed |
| [004](ADR-004-provider-capability-declaration.md) | Provider capability declaration — `topology_capability` + `mobility` + `operational_capability`; what placement & operational/SRE policies match against | Proposed |
| [005](ADR-005-time-integrity.md) | Time integrity — ordering is structural (hash-linked sequence + causal DAG, not clocks); time-sync is a profile-declared adopt-by-reference capability enforced by placement; cross-peer integrity via mutual signed checkpoints; leap-seconds require-monotonic/recommend-smear | Proposed |
| [006](ADR-006-convergence-control-model.md) | Convergence control model — Data·Policy·Provider are peers in an event-condition-action loop where **policy is re-entrant** (re-triggered by provider change/denial/drift); soundness rules = bounded convergence, idempotent re-entry, causal audit of triggers | Proposed |
| [007](ADR-007-profile-model.md) | Profile model — profiles are composed **sets** (policies + operational config + required mechanics), not levels; they set floors; built-in profiles are immutable and modification **forks a custom profile**; org-defined mechanics (e.g. approval ladder); platform-scoped now, group-scopable later | Proposed |
| [008](ADR-008-udlm-dcm-boundary.md) | The UDLM/DCM boundary — the peer test (could an independent peer do this differently and still be valid? yes→DCM, no→UDLM); UDLM = wire-compatible substrate, DCM = one implementation; wire-compatibility not implementation portability (K8s precedent) | Proposed |
| [009](ADR-009-dependency-fulfillment.md) | Dependency fulfillment — who procures a dependent resource, and how a type accommodates a broker | Proposed |
| [010](ADR-010-dependency-graph-completion.md) | Dependency-graph completion — fault domains, blast radius, and the unmet-dependency diagnostic | Proposed |
| [011](ADR-011-validate-and-reserve.md) | Validate-and-reserve — two-phase realization | Proposed |
| [012](ADR-012-data-references.md) | Data references — the object-reference shape for shared reference data (uuid-authoritative, version-pinned) | Proposed |
| [013](ADR-013-hardware-component-scope.md) | UDLM/DCM is not a hardware component system-of-record (for now) — control plane, not DCIM | Proposed |
| [014](ADR-014-resource-type-optionality-conformity.md) | Resource-type data — optionality with conformity (transport, not policy) | Proposed |
| [015](ADR-015-settings-and-config-bundles.md) | Settings and configuration bundles | Proposed |
| [016](ADR-016-resource-type-role-graph-audit-not-config.md) | What a Resource Type models — the portable definition; provider-specific config stored extra; DCM is the state system-of-record | Proposed |
| [017](ADR-017-profile-homelab.md) | The Homelab profile — the single-operator on-ramp | Proposed |
| [018](ADR-018-profile-dev.md) | The Dev profile — the evaluation / co-engineering target | Proposed |
| [019](ADR-019-profile-standard.md) | The Standard profile — baseline production | Proposed |
| [020](ADR-020-profile-prod.md) | The Prod profile — hardened production | Proposed |
| [021](ADR-021-profile-fsi.md) | The FSI profile — regulated (financial-services) production | Proposed |
| [022](ADR-022-profile-sovereign.md) | The Sovereign profile — data sovereignty (strictest floor) | Proposed |
| [023](ADR-023-host-networking-as-data-nmstate.md) | Host networking as data — adopt NMstate + RFC 8344 for the addressing family | Proposed |
| [024](ADR-024-filling-provider-required-inputs.md) | Filling provider-required inputs — layers stage data, policies refine and validate | Proposed |
| [025](ADR-025-resource-references.md) | Resource references — AEP-124 resource association, resolved at reserve | Proposed |
| [026](ADR-026-typed-classification-naming.md) | Typed-classification naming — `<noun>_type` convention (`resource_type`/`entity_type`/`edge_type`); `type` namespaced by noun, not synonyms; `kind` retired for edges (non-standard + k8s object-`kind` collision), may remain for source discriminators | Proposed |
| [027](ADR-027-entity-family-model.md) | Entity family model — `family` = state vs execution (Resource/Process/Knowledge/Access); `entity_type` = Atomic/Composite shape from DCM's orchestration perspective; retire infrastructure/persistent/durable; `resource_type` = specific tier | Proposed |
| [028](ADR-028-rule-id-naming-and-registry.md) | Rule-ID naming + central registry — `PREFIX-NNN`, one prefix = one family = one home file, immutable IDs; `registry/rule-id-registry.yaml` is the source of truth; `check_single_source.py` (now CI-wired) enforces registered + single-homed | Proposed |
| [029](ADR-029-inventory-ancillary-types.md) | Inventory — optional ancillary observed-resource types (`classification: ancillary`, observe-only, `contained_by` substrate); opt-in via profile + capability + optional tier (no new mechanism); DCM stays the SoR for what it owns, not a complete inventory SoR; refines ADR-013; revives Hardware.Processor/StorageDevice/GraphicsProcessor | Proposed |
| [030](ADR-030-convergence-lifecycle-model.md) | The convergence lifecycle — one model beneath the families: Intent + Realized + a gap + Converge (ADR-006 completed); one act, two trigger-classes (intent-moved/target-moved); decommission is an intent value not an act; nature (maintained/work-product/curated) is durable, timeline/terminal/provenance are parameters; Resource/Process/Credential/Inventory/Knowledge are archetype presets. Post-1.0 direction; refines ADR-027 | Proposed |
| [031](ADR-031-one-zero-scope-focus.md) | 0.1 scope + focus — the 21 September use cases are the sole gravity well for 0.1 implementation; everything else is a minimal operational unblock or a Proposed ADR (binds nothing); remaining = ratify ADRs + conformance + 0.1→1.0 restamp | Proposed |
| [032](ADR-032-post-one-zero-direction.md) | Post-1.0 direction — "pre-1.0, pay only to remove a future-contradiction, never to pre-build a feature"; the one contradiction to avoid is hardening Resource/Process into closed species; cards on the table are Proposed ADRs; records the convergence-model direction for future-us | Proposed |
| [033](ADR-033-templates.md) | Templates — the orderable assembly, and Pattern → Template → System as the ADR-030 lifecycle (Intent → Requested → Realized) at assembly scale; Template ≈ TOSCA Service Template / OAM Application (chosen over the vendor-in-retreat "Blueprint"); Pattern = type-level intent in Knowledge (Antipattern's twin); processes bound not contained; Day-N a projection; composable infra is a Provider capability (ADR-004); on-ramp to LikeC4/C4/TOSCA. Post-1.0 direction | Proposed |
| [034](ADR-034-composite-service-is-template.md) | Composite Service **is** a Template (proposed / eng-discussion) — one orderable-composite tier, not two names for one objective; Template adopts catalog-item.schema.json as its 1.0 grounding (Composite Service = resources-only Template); Composite Entity → System; CMP-* → TPL-*; finishes retiring the "composite" tag after ADR-027 single/multi. Binds nothing until ratified | Proposed |
| [035](ADR-035-reference-vocabulary-portability.md) | Reference-vocabulary portability — a *referenced* vocabulary (`os_image`, `storage_class`, …) is portable via adopted identity + provider-advertised eligibility + validated membership; an application of ADR-037 (PVD) | Proposed |
| [036](ADR-036-storage-selection-requirements.md) | Storage selection is **requirements-based** — a requirements descriptor, never a reference to a (Kubernetes-native) storage class; an application of ADR-037 (PVD) | Proposed |
| [037](ADR-037-portable-value-discipline.md) | Portable-value discipline (PVD) — a selectable value is a **reference, codelist, or requirement**; never a free string or an inline re-expression of an adopted standard | Proposed |
| [038](ADR-038-scoped-resource-type-classes.md) | Scoped resource-type Class hierarchy — **Base / Type / Provider Classes** of scoped `SharedDataElement`s; one meta-model unifying base fields, shared vocabularies, and provider extensions (subsumes `provider_extensions`, retirement #202); portability legible from the name; URL-native addressing coordinate (§10) | Proposed — downstream adoption pending eng alignment |
| [039](ADR-039-vocabulary-ingest.md) | Vocabulary ingest — reference vocabularies populated as staged (`proposed → canonical`), cleaned, provenance-tracked **Data**; minimal-toil ingestion | Proposed |
| [040](ADR-040-federation-resolution.md) | Federation resolution (**STUB**) — how rooted addresses resolve across peers / tenants / sovereignty borders; deferred, demand-driven, `peer` root first | Proposed (stub) |
| [041](ADR-041-policy-information-firewall.md) | Policy as information firewall — boundary mediation: egress *release* + ingress *admission* control, structural (unresolved reference) vs value (resolved datum) inspection, resolver + reactive re-convergence, cross-domain guard for high-assurance zones | Proposed |
| [042](ADR-042-standard-neutrality-and-portability-policy.md) | Enable, don't mandate — the **pattern** for opt-in standards governance without an approved-standards list: derive a *descriptive* property (from the standard's governing body), let policy evaluate it (ADR-041), let an org **profile** set the stance. UDLM describes; the org decides. The `neutrality` + portability-strictness (`off`/`warn`/`deny`) illustration is **consumer-gated — recorded, not built** until a UC asks (ADR-032). No new rule/primitive/store | Proposed |
| [043](ADR-043-managed-by-relation-deferred.md) | No `managed_by` relation — the typed target is the context; ordering lives in `edge_type`; a relation name earns its way in only via a naming standard or a same-type disambiguation need; deferred with a defined re-review trigger | Proposed |
| [044](ADR-044-consumer-conformance-surface.md) | Consumer conformance surface — consumers declare their read surface in `registry/consumers/*.yaml` (named types + the version last verified against, or `consumes_all_types` for envelope-level readers); the registry gates on it: every declared type exists, no declared version is ahead of the registry, every registry type is consumed or explicitly acknowledged in `unconsumed.yaml` (regenerated-and-compared, ratchet style); `declared` → `verified` promotion is the consumer's own CI act | Proposed |
| [045](ADR-045-class-evolution-and-pinning.md) | Class evolution and pinning — atomic recompilation (one change set regenerates every descendant with a sufficient bump), machine-enumerated blast radius (class graph + ADR-044 manifests), two-plane pin rule (intra-registry references by handle only, the registry ref is the sole internal pin; organization-edge pins `@version`/`@digest`, honored completely, behind = enumerated debt, ahead/unknown = refused), element scope narrowing is breaking (portability is part of the compat contract), inheritance depth capped at three. **Amended by ADR-051** (pin/provenance/provider-surface clauses restated on the identity/version/digest model) | Proposed |
| [046](ADR-046-blue-green-promotion-contract.md) | Blue/green promotion contract — re-pins promote on evidence, not version claims: one intent corpus compiled under pinned and candidate revisions, dry-run realized, declared typed outputs diffed; clean-or-approved diff promotes atomically with the diff preserved as attestation evidence; dirty diff refuses and routes the contradicted compatibility claim back to the registry as a finding; blue/green is the reference approach, not the requirement — the evidence contract is UDLM's, the mechanism choice is DCM's (ADR-008 boundary); provider swap and class upgrade share one evidence surface | Proposed |
| [047](ADR-047-settings-precedence-resolution.md) | Settings precedence resolution — ratified as REUSE: resolution is the ADR-015 §2a derived projection (select/order/compose, effective value + provenance), compute-never-store, LAY-005/008 per-value provenance, ADR-045 §7 render provenance on generated projections; adds the same-tier tie-break — explicit `precedence_order`, and an undeclared same-tier conflict on one setting is a typed refusal naming both sources | Proposed |
| [048](ADR-048-staleness-as-declared-expectation.md) | Staleness as declared expectation — one `expected_observation` element on the realized envelope (cadence or window + `on_exceeded`); verdicts `current \| stale_expected \| stale_deviant` derived, never stored; OBS-005 profile TTL demoted to the fallback; the group-scope value composes per ADR-015 (envelope carries the resolved expectation + provenance); the Knowledge Base-tier twin (`as_of`/`valid_until`/`refresh_cadence`) is the named phase-2 destination when the class carrier lands | Proposed |
| [049](ADR-049-credential-material-at-intent-intake.md) | Credential material at intent intake — **UDLM fixes the invariant** (inline credential material is detected and refused *before* the immutable Intent record persists it; the refusal echoes neither the value nor a quote in store, error, or audit `detail`); **the mechanism and its rigor are delegated to policy/profile — a DCM obligation.** A profile sets the floor (detect-and-refuse, or raise to coercion-to-a-reference on the ADR-039 match/mint precedent); DCM picks the mechanism. The mechanism catalogue in the ADR is informative. Settled by the ADR-008 peer test | Proposed |
| [050](ADR-050-absolute-provider-pin.md) | The absolute provider pin — **UDLM fixes the invariant** (the `effective_capabilities` ceiling always applies at the dispatch boundary; a pin is preference *among eligible* providers, never a bypass; an ineligible pin → `placement.capability_mismatch` before dispatch); **whether a deliberate bypass exists is an operational policy — a DCM obligation**, priced through the existing override-record flow (`policy-contract.md` §18). Also settles the corpus typing: capability mismatch is `policy_violation`, not `provider.*`. Settled by the ADR-008 peer test | Proposed |
| [051](ADR-051-identity-version-revision.md) | Identity, version, digest — one meaning per field: uuid = frozen identity (never rotates, never reused); version = the semver compat contract under the publish law ((identity, version) immutable once published); change transparency = sha256 over RFC 8785-canonical content, carried in generated referrers (pin manifest, provenance, attestations) never in the artifact itself; pins are `thing@version` or `thing@sha256:<hex>`; two document families (mutable-in-place bumps version, immutable record streams supersede); accreditation exact-by-default on attested digests. Retires uuid rotation; amends ADR-045; existing uuids frozen in place | Proposed |
| [052](ADR-052-intent-fulfillment-dependency-nature.md) | Intent fulfillment — dependency **nature** (`request` \| `operational`) as the one new field, extending the existing edge, not a parallel `atomic` flag or best_effort/all_or_nothing axis: operational = realized-layer functional coupling (directional cascade, independents proceed, keeps `strength`), request = intent-layer atomicity (hold-all activation + cancel-all from one binding). Convergence **window** intent field defaulting to *defer* (the give-up bound is DCM policy — no wall-clock in the portable model); convergence status is a **derived projection** (seven verdicts, never stored, per ADR-048); mandatory surfacing must name the **root** dependency + chain + nature + verdict (+ resolution on refusal). The T7 *extend-before-net-new* exemplar; corpus-measured (nine UCs). **0.1 work — 1.0 conferred by engineering acceptance (#217)** | Proposed |
| [053](ADR-053-change-control-policy-vocabulary.md) | Change-control — a **`schedule`** clause family (window/freeze/expedite/precondition) on the existing policy object, not a new policy_type; the **whether/when firewall** (a schedule clause governs *when*, never *whether* — no clause, expedite included, waives the ADR-046 evidence diff); **typed adoption debt** as a derived verdict (`pin_behind`\|`windowed`\|`frozen`, never stored, per ADR-048/052); approvals as a **sign-off referrer** binding approver + evidence digest (reuse the attestation shape, ADR-051); change policies are **versioned + prospective** with a governing meta-policy (UC-016); windows may be **sourced knowledge** (change-calendar Knowledge type via `provider.kind: information`, adopt-by-reference, authority-per-scope, stale-fails-closed); **freshness** reuses ADR-048 and lands on the Knowledge Base Class. The T7 exemplar (extends 8 existing surfaces, coins ~1); corpus-measured (17 UCs). **0.1 work** | Proposed |
| [055](ADR-055-in-spec-examples.md) | Worked examples live **in the spec** at `spec.examples` (the JSON Schema / OpenAPI 3.1 `examples` keyword, co-located with the schema), adopted by reference (T5); **every in-spec example validates against its own spec schema** (`EXG-001`, hard — Spectral's `oas3-valid-schema-example`, UDLM-side) and every spec carries one unless burn-down-baselined (`EXG-002`); the example is a **non-normative annotation excluded from the identity digest** (ADR-051), so refreshing it never forces a version bump; external-only examples collapse back into the spec. Closes the deferred rule-36 G4 / D8 example-bar ruling | Proposed |
| [057](ADR-057-sovereignty-placement-and-provenance.md) | Sovereignty has **two dimensions** — **placement** (P4 today: immutable zone fields, an entity can't leave its zone) **and provenance/admission** (is the entity, and the sources that realize it, from an **approved source / on the approved list** for this boundary?). UDLM's role for both is identical and bounded (ADR-008): **codify the requirement as immutable data + communicate it; never vet or enforce** — DCM's Governance Matrix decides/enforces, reusing **attestation R2** + **accreditation** + **capability-admission** (default-deny, ADR-PROV-003), *no new machinery*. Amends P4; closes the glossary-vs-spec gap on sovereignty. Foundations; ratification-gated | Proposed |
| [056](ADR-056-realization-renamed-implementation.md) | Legibility — the noun for *a system that implements UDLM* is renamed **realization → implementation** (UDLM is **implementation-neutral**), de-overloading it from the `realize`/**Realized** lifecycle it collided with; the **lifecycle/act sense is unchanged** (`realize`, `Realized`, two-phase realization, `realization_timestamp`); **one wire break** — the accreditation enum `peer_realization` → `peer_implementation`, legacy label documented for migration, so it is **engineering-ratification-gated**; immutable `decision_record`s are not rewritten (ADR-051 R4a); four type specs ship a REVISION bump. Foundations-legibility work | Proposed |
| [054](ADR-054-references-context-and-field-projection.md) | Orthogonal data — the **references-context** axis (a resource's context data as a *classified, dereferenceable edge*, not an assembly layer; `reference_data` retired from `layer_type`), **field projection along an edge** (the navigational coordinate `self.located-in.network.fabric_id` → a derived layer value with provenance + dual anchor; invariants `PROJ-P1..P5`, ADR-041 adds P6), and **two-sided layer scoping** (`covers`/`applies_on` ⋈ `from_layers`/`skip`; injection = the intersection). Extracted from ADR-038 while both are Proposed so the Class paradigm and this mechanism ratify separately | Proposed |
