# UDLM ADR-045: Class evolution and pinning — atomic recompilation, two-plane pins, portability in the compat contract

**Status:** Proposed (croadfeldt upstream) — pending engineering ratification (#217); decided 2026-07-25. **Amended by ADR-051** (identity/version/digest — the uuid is frozen identity; revision exactness moved to content digests; the pin, provenance, and provider-surface clauses below carry the amended text).
**Date:** 2026-07-25
**Type:** Architecture Decision Record (a `DecisionRecord`, architecture scope)
**Background — read first (the cold reader's on-ramp; skip if you have the context).** Each cited once with what it settles. The class system this governs (ADR-038 —
Base/Type/Provider Classes of SharedDataElements, portability derived from element scope), the
versioning doctrine it extends (VERSIONING.md § "Identity, version, digest" — uuid is frozen
identity, the version bumps under the publish law, the digest names the exact bytes), the
pin-behind precedent it generalizes (the estate's
type-version pinning: behind is legal, enumerated debt — never silent), the consumer surface
the blast radius reads (ADR-044 — consumers declare what they read), and the corpus that
measures it ([`use-cases/class-versioning/`](../../use-cases/class-versioning/README.md) —
cases 001–006 and 009 encode this ADR's rulings as testable contracts).

## Context

The class system rebuilds every resource, process, and provider definition as a composition
over shared building blocks, arranged in three levels: Base elements everything in a category
shares, Type elements multiple providers support, and Provider elements specific to one
engine. That concentration is the point — one Base element serves dozens of descendants — and
also the risk: a Base change ripples into every Type Class, Provider Class,
and generated flat spec built on it. Software inheritance met this as the fragile-base-class
problem and never fully solved it, because behavioral compatibility is undecidable. Ours is
decidable: classes are data contracts, descendants are compiled artifacts, and the ripple is a
computable set. The questions to settle are when recompilation happens, where version pins are
legal, and what "compatible" means when the thing that changes is not a schema shape but an
element's scope.

## Decision

**1. Recompilation is atomic.** A class change and every affected descendant land in one
change set: **generated flat specs regenerate**; **authored Type and Provider Classes
revalidate**, bumping version only where their own content actually changes (the identity
gate's no-op rule holds — an unchanged authored file never re-versions; its uuid never moves
either way, ADR-051). Every artifact whose content changes takes a bump the compat gate
accepts as sufficient — which
pre-1.0 means the **MINOR floor** for breaking classifications (VERSIONING.md, "the pre-1.0
bump floor"), never a REVISION and never a jump to 1.0. Lazy
regeneration is rejected: it would let one release carry two truths of the same element, which
is version skew inside a single source. The cost — Base changes produce large diffs — is
accurate reporting, not overhead: a Base change is large, and the diff is where its size
should be visible. Atomicity is **registry-internal** — consistency of the source, never
propagation: estates, pins, and realized instances are untouched (Decision 3; §8
realized-instance stability) and encounter the change only as surfaced blast radius and
visible debt, adopted under their own change policies (the operational response matrix).

**2. The blast radius is machine-enumerated, never hand-listed.** A class change carries the
computed set of affected artifacts, derived from the class graph, plus the downstream
consumers that will accrue version debt, derived from the ADR-044 manifests. The enumeration
is part of the durable change record.

**3. The software-industry mapping is adopted: the registry is the library, an organization's
estate is the application.** Libraries declare compatible ranges and never pin; applications
pin exactly and own their upgrades. Concretely:

- **Intra-registry references are by handle only.** A Type or Provider Class that pins a fixed
  Base version inside the registry is refused at validation — the registry ref (commit) is the
  sole intra-registry pin, and it pins everything at once.
- **Organization-edge pins are first-class: `thing@version`, or `thing@sha256:<hex>` for
  exact bytes** (ADR-051). The publish law makes the version pin meaningful — a published
  (identity, version) is immutable — and the digest pin is exact by construction. The
  revision store is the registry's git history: a pin
  resolves within the registry ref (or ref range) the estate declares it consumes — which is
  how behind-but-legal and unknown-refused are mechanically distinct. A pin carrying both
  `version` and `digest` must carry a matching pair; a mismatch is refused, and the digest is
  authoritative. A pinned estate compiles and realizes against the pinned revision completely;
  nothing upstream propagates until the organization re-pins.
- **Pin-behind is legal, enumerated debt.** The version distance appears per pinned artifact
  in the estate's own validation output and re-opens when the estate's registry ref advances —
  the standing estate discipline, applied unchanged to classes. **Pin-ahead or
  pin-to-nonexistent is refused**, typed distinctly from legal debt (the ADR-044
  `noted_version` rule, generalized).

This dissolves the apparent conflict between organizational control and the versioning model:
the model never forbade consumer-edge pinning — it forbids being *silently* behind. Complete
control and complete visibility are the same mechanism.

**4. Element scope is part of the compatibility contract.** Portability is derived from scope
position (ADR-038), so moving an element to a narrower scope (Base → Type, Type → Provider)
shrinks the portable surface of every carrier — a **breaking** change even when no schema
shape changes, classified by rule, not review judgment. Scope widening is compatible. No
schema differ can see this class of break; the compat gate must implement the scope rule
explicitly.

**5. The inheritance depth stays at three scope planes.** Base/Type/Provider is a ruling,
not a habit — ripple cost grows with depth, and the three scopes are exactly the portability
distinctions the model needs. This caps the **class-hierarchy planes**, and is orthogonal to
ADR-038's naming-depth rule ("unbounded, but governed"), which governs **dotted address
depth** within elements — both stand; neither supersedes the other. A proposed fourth scope
plane is a re-review trigger for this ADR.

**6. Ruled edge cases.**
- **Element deletion** is breaking (the VERSIONING.md remove-a-field row), handled by the same
  atomic path as narrowing: one change set, blast radius enumerated, MINOR-floor bump pre-1.0.
- **Pins are subtree-consistent.** Pinning a class pins its ancestor chain; two pins in one
  estate that resolve the same ancestor to different revisions are refused — the intra-registry
  two-truths ban, applied at the estate edge (no diamond skew).
- **A shared artifact resolves under exactly one pin set** — its owning estate's. Consumers in
  differently-pinned estates read the owner's compiled-against record; they do not re-resolve
  it under their own pins.

**7. Provenance is declared, verified, and two-plane.** Every generated flat spec carries a
compilation-provenance block naming the exact revisions (handle, version, digest — ADR-051's
referrer rule puts the digest in the provenance block, never in the input artifact) of every input
— Base, Type, and Provider classes, shared-element layers, referenced common schemas, and the
generator version — so "the artifact contains its chain" is verifiable, not asserted. Every
realized instance extends this with implementation provenance: the provider definition/
registration revision and engine binding version that realized it. Live provenance means the
current artifact states its inputs; historical provenance means any past revision's full chain
reconstructs mechanically from the revision store (immutable published revisions — each named
by its digest — make history a database).
Provenance is only worth carrying if verified: recompiling from the block's named inputs must
reproduce the artifact byte-comparably, and a mismatch (a hand-edit after generation, a stale
block) is refused at the gate as an integrity failure. Corpus: class-versioning 010–012.

**8. Providers version their edge, and only their edge.** A provider's declared surface — the
capabilities it registers, the standards it adopts, the defaults it publishes, and the outputs
it populates per type — is a versioned contract under exactly the standard rules: additive
surface changes are compatible, removals and shape changes are breaking, the same bump floors
apply, and any change to the definition bumps its version under the publish law (ADR-051 —
the definition's uuid is its frozen identity, which is exactly what lets an accreditation
stay anchored to it across edits). Past the naturalization boundary
(dcm ADR-023 — where provider-native implementation begins), the provider is free: engine
internals, dependencies, and implementation may change without any versioning obligation
toward consumers, because nothing a consumer can bind to has changed. The seam is precise:
an internal change that alters a populated output's observable shape *is* a surface change and
versions accordingly. Individual capabilities remain their own accreditation/version units
(ADR-004), nested within the definition's version; the engine binding version an implementation
actually used is recorded in implementation provenance (§7). Pins, debt, and blue/green promotion
apply to provider definitions unchanged — an estate pins a provider definition revision the
same way it pins a class revision, and an engine upgrade verifies by output diff (the
process-migration stage's engine-upgrade-regression pattern).

Provider versioning is **two-plane** — the registry's own pattern (individually versioned
types, whole-release pinned by ref), recurring: **capabilities version individually** as the
contract unit consumers bind to, and the **provider definition revision — the definition
pinned `@version` or `@sha256:<hex>` (ADR-051) — is the whole-surface pin**. All compat classification routes to the capability plane: a breaking
change inside one capability majors *that capability* and reaches exactly the consumers bound
through the types it covers (`covers_types` — the explicit capability↔type linkage), never
churning consumers of the provider's other capabilities. The **envelope version carries set
semantics only**: capability added = minor, capability removed = major, provider-wide
defaults/standards on their own merits — a member's internal breaking change does not major
the envelope, because the set did not change. Consumers bind and pin at the finest unit they
consume (the capability — identified by its frozen `capability_uuid`, pinned at a version or
digest); estate-wide conservatism pins the definition
revision. Implementation provenance (§7) records the **capability revision** that governed a
implementation alongside the definition revision and engine binding. The operational payoff is
**capability-level blue/green**: one capability's v2 runs green under ADR-046's promotion
contract while sibling capabilities keep serving on their current versions — staged provider
evolution without whole-provider upgrades. **Realized instances are stable under capability movement.** A capability version change —
compatible or breaking — never triggers a redeploy, update, or reconciliation of instances
already realized under an earlier capability revision: implementation provenance is immutable
fact, and a running instance's contract is the revision that governed its implementation. The
movement is *surfaced* at instance level (realized-under vs current-capability distance, typed
distinctly from spec pin-lag) and the organization's change policy decides — update, re-realize
under the new revision (blue/green when breaking), or deliberately nothing, which is
legitimate. Breaking-ness matters at the *next* implementation, never retroactively to a running
one. The industry's own version of this rule is building codes: a house built to the
2019 code is not upgraded when the 2022 code publishes — once built, the object has a life of
its own — but a *renovation* is where current-code adoption gets decided. Mapped here:
**every voluntary touch — a day-2 change, a rebuild, a re-realization — is a declared decision
point.** The system surfaces the instance's provenance-distance at the touch; the estate's
policy decides whether the touch adopts current revisions, offers the choice, or proceeds
under governing provenance; all three are enabled, recorded outcomes. The touch-trigger stance
(adopt-on-touch, offer-on-touch, provenance-until-explicit) is a policy clause like any other
— declared once, never improvised per touch. The analogy has two faces and both are
load-bearing: the house's protection from the new code is one; the other is that the code's
publication is **surfaced the day it lands** — the owner always sees the distance, and "not
until renovation" is a decision the owner *makes and records* (the provenance-until-explicit
stance, declared), never a default that happens by silence. Surfacing is continuous; deciding
is always available — an organization may adopt between touches whenever it chooses; the touch
is simply the moment the system re-asks the question instead of the calendar. Three rules make this stability real rather than aspirational: **mixed-version
operation is supported by contract** — a capability's day-2 verbs (update, resize, snapshot,
delete) must keep operating instances realized under any of its non-retired revisions, so a
1.2.0-realized instance is operable while current is 1.3.0; **realized instances are pinned
consumers** — a capability revision with instances realized under it cannot retire without the
published deprecation window, making retirement the one legitimate, calendared forcing
function; and **drift compares against provenance, never against current** — reconciliation
that measured a 1.2.0-realized instance against the 1.3.0 contract would manufacture phantom
drift fleet-wide and "fix" it into exactly the mass redeploy this rule forbids. Accreditation stays at the capability (ADR-004),
untouched by the envelope. Corpus: class-versioning 013–020.

## Consequences

- Every Base change re-proves all descendants mechanically: atomic recompilation means the
  instance-fuzz, composition, and compat gates run against every regenerated spec in the same
  commit — the class system inherits the whole deterministic hammer suite with no new tests.
- Registry evolution stays honest: blast radius in the change record, debt in the estate's
  output, nothing silent anywhere in the chain.
- Organizations can be arbitrarily conservative without forking: a fully-pinned estate is a
  supported state whose cost is a visible debt list, and ADR-046's blue/green contract is the
  instrument that retires the debt with evidence.
- Gate work this creates (implementation-plan P0): the class-compat classifier (including the
  scope rule), the blast-radius enumerator, and pin resolution validation on both planes.
