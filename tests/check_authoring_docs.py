"""Guide-integrity gate (DOC-002): the contributor guides must not rot. Every repo path a guide points
at — a schema, a gate, a worked example, a sibling guide — must exist. A guide that references a deleted
gate or a renamed schema is worse than none, because a newcomer follows it verbatim.

Scope: the distribution guides — docs/working-with-udlm.md, docs/authoring/**, and the role guides
(docs/reviewing.md, docs/consuming.md, docs/contributing-guide.md). For each, this checks:
  - every Markdown link `[text](target)` to a relative path resolves to a real file;
  - every backticked repo path (registry/…, tests/…, scripts/…, use-cases/…, docs/…, .github/…) exists
    (globs and pure directory mentions are allowed — a dir must still exist).

Exit 0 = every reference resolves. This is how the guides stay accurate as the model evolves.
