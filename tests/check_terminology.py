"""Terminology guard (TERM-001): the locked vocabulary decisions, enforced across the repo's text.

Rule home: CONTRIBUTING.md § "Terminology discipline (TERM-001)" — a term retired by a ruling
does not reappear in living text; a line that documents the retirement is not a use of it.

Ported from the dcm repo's gate (same architecture: rules table, exemptions, per-line history
markers) after the retired term "gating policy" regressed into a corpus file and two flow docs
with nothing upstream to catch it. Scans tracked text files; a forbidden term fails CI UNLESS
the file+rule is exempt (the file's purpose is recording that decision) or the line explicitly
documents the change.

Rules are udlm-scoped: dcm's "resource provider" and "likeC4" rules are deliberately absent
(this registry legitimately names LikeC4 as an external interop format, and "resource
provider" appears in blessed contexts). Grow the table with the ruling that retires a term.

Evasions closed 2026-07-25 (each with the live corpus violation it exposed):
  1. LINE WRAP — a term split across two lines evaded a line-based regex. The scan now also
     tests each line joined to its successor. Caught: contracts/time-and-clock.md §8, where
     "the hash\\nchain" carried the retired linear-chain wording past the gate.
  2. BARE ARROW — the history marker accepted "→"/"->" anywhere on the line, so any line with
     an arrow (most of this spec's prose) was skipped wholesale. Arrows are no longer markers;
     the words that actually document a change are. Caught: tests/test-framework-specification.md
     MRKL-004, "verify hash chain" on an arrow-bearing row.
  3. HYPHENATION — "gating-policy" evaded `gating\\s+polic`. Separators are now `[-\\s]+`.
  4. BLANKET EXEMPTIONS — whole-file and whole-directory exemptions hid every rule, not the one
     the file legitimately names. Exemptions are now (file → rules), and the
     `registry/instances/` directory exemption is one file + one rule.
Known limit (deliberate): the join is pairwise, so a term spread across three lines still
evades; and matching is per-file, so a term reintroduced in a binary or untracked file is
out of scope.
