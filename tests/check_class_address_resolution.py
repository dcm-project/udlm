"""Guards dotted-address resolution over the scoped-Class hierarchy (ADR-038 / P0).

Asserts the resolver (registry/tools/resolve_class_address.py) walks inheritance correctly across
both the Compute (depth) and Process (multi-provider) chains, and that unresolvable addresses fail
deterministically. Doubles as a regression guard: renaming or moving an element, or breaking a
`parent` link, trips this. Exit 0 = all cases hold; 1 = a resolution changed.
