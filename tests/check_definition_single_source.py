"""Single-source guard for *named concept definitions* (not rule IDs).

Companion to check_single_source.py. That guard enforces "one rule-ID, one home" on rule
rows (INF-001, DPO-003, …). This one covers the case that guard cannot see: a named framework
*re-defined* in prose in a second file while its canonical home is elsewhere — exactly how the
Design Priority Order framework ended up spelled out in both design-priorities.md (its home) and
foundations.md, in *different words* (so a text-match guard would miss it too).

The robust signal is structural, not textual. A concept has one home file. Any OTHER file may
*reference* the concept — a short pointer section that links to the home — but must not
*re-define* it. A re-definition is detected by an enumerated body under the concept's heading:
a numbered list or a Markdown table. A one-line orientation + link (the conceded form) is fine.

To register a concept: add a CANONICAL row (concept name, heading regex, home file). To
grandfather a known-but-not-yet-fixed restatement, add a (concept, file) pair to BASELINE — the
check stays green and ratchets (a baseline pair that no longer restates is reported as stale so
it gets removed). Exit 0 clean, 1 on a new restatement.
