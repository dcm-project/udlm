"""CI compat gate — makes SPEC-DESIGN §9 [enforced: compat-check] real.

For every resource-type spec that differs from the base ref (default origin/main), run
registry/tools/compat-check.py with old=base-version, new=working-version and fail if the
declared `version` bump is under-declared (a breaking change shipped as MINOR/REVISION, etc.).
New type files (absent on base) are skipped — there is no prior version to compare.

Usage: tests/ci_compat_gate.py [base_ref]   (base_ref default: origin/main)
Exit 0 = all changed specs declare a sufficient bump (or are new); 1 = at least one
under-declared. Wire into .github/workflows/validate.yml.
