"""Graph-integrity gate: the dependency graph is declared one-sided and made two-sided by DERIVATION.
An edge is declared once on its natural owner; the reverse is not stored, it is computed by inverting
the edge (registry/edge-types.yaml). For that to be sound, three things must hold — this gate enforces
them so a one-sided declaration is never a one-sided *graph*:

  GRAPH-001  the edge-type registry matches the `edge_type` enum in resource-type-spec.schema.json
             (single source — the inverse map can't drift from the allowed edge types).
  GRAPH-002  every relationship edge's `target` resolves to a real node (a resource type or Class).
             A dangling target means the derived inverse would land on nothing — the graph tears.
  GRAPH-003  every declared edge has a defined inverse, so B→A is derivable for every A→B. Reported as
             the two-sided adjacency (declared + derived), proving the graph is navigable both ways.

This is why relationships are declared on one endpoint only (single-source, no drift) and still form a
complete bidirectional graph. Run with --emit to write the materialized two-sided graph.
